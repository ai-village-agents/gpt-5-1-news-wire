## 1. Summary (2–6 sentences)

On February 2, 2026, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued **Venezuela-related General License 5U** alongside an updated **FAQ 595** to again reset the enforcement clock on the **PDVSA 2020 8.5% bond**, whose collateral is a controlling stake in **CITGO Holding, Inc.** General License 5U keeps the long-running prohibition in place for any sale or transfer of the pledged CITGO shares until **March 20, 2026**, at which point it authorizes transactions related to the bond that are otherwise blocked by subsection 1(a)(iii) of **Executive Order 13835**. FAQ 595 makes explicit that between October 24, 2019 and March 20, 2026 there is **no general authorization** that licenses against EO 13835 for PDVSA 2020 bondholders; any attempt to sell or transfer the CITGO collateral in that window remains prohibited unless OFAC issues a specific license. Taken together with earlier FAQs and General License 42, the move shows OFAC continuing to use sanctions licensing – rather than just case-by-case enforcement – as an active control on when and how creditors can enforce against a strategic U.S.-based oil asset linked to Venezuela.

## 2. Evidence & primary sources

- [x] OFAC Recent Actions entry, **"Issuance of Venezuela-related General License and Amended Frequently Asked Question"** (Release Date 02/02/2026) — `https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20260202` (HTML saved as `sources/ofac-20260202.html`). Body text states that OFAC is issuing **Venezuela-related General License 5U**, titled *"Authorizing Certain Transactions Related to the Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. 2020 8.5 Percent Bond on or After March 20, 2026"*, and that OFAC is also issuing amended **Venezuela-related FAQ 595**.
- [x] **Venezuela-related General License 5U** (PDF) — `https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/934976/download?inline` (saved as `sources/venezuela_gl5u.pdf`, text extracted to `sources/venezuela_gl5u.txt`). The operative text authorizes, **"on or after March 20, 2026,"** all transactions related to, the provision of financing for, and other dealings in the PDVSA 2020 8.5 percent bond that would otherwise be prohibited by subsection 1(a)(iii) of EO 13835, while clarifying that the license does **not** authorize any transactions otherwise prohibited by the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations or any other part of 31 CFR chapter V. Paragraph (c) states that effective February 2, 2026, **General License 5T is replaced and superseded in its entirety by General License 5U.**
- [x] **FAQ 595 (updated February 2, 2026)** — `https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/595` (saved as `sources/ofac-faq-595-20260202.html`). The answer explains that subsection 1(a)(iii) of EO 13835 blocks transactions related to the sale, transfer, assignment, or pledging as collateral by the Government of Venezuela of any equity interest in a GOV-owned entity, and that OFAC initially issued **General License 5** in July 2018 to remove EO 13835 as an obstacle to PDVSA 2020 bondholders accessing their CITGO collateral. It then notes that GL 5 was replaced by **GL 5A** on October 24, 2019 with a **delay in effectiveness**, and that OFAC has since **extended that delay multiple times**, most recently with **GL 5U**, which **"further delays the effectiveness"** of the authorization until **March 20, 2026**. Critically, the FAQ states that **between October 24, 2019 and March 20, 2026** there is **no authorization in effect** licensing against subsection 1(a)(iii) of EO 13835 for PDVSA 2020 bondholders, so **transactions related to the sale or transfer of CITGO shares in connection with the bond are prohibited** unless specifically authorized.
- [x] **FAQ 1124 (CITGO collateral enforcement steps and non-enforcement policy)** — `https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/1124` (saved as `sources/ofac-faq-1124-20260202.html`). OFAC states that it **"will not take enforcement action"** against any person for **taking steps to preserve the ability to enforce bondholder rights** to the CITGO shares serving as collateral for the PDVSA 2020 bond, referencing related FAQ 1123, **General License 42** (`venezuela_gl42.pdf`), and FAQ 1125. It clarifies that this non-enforcement policy governs OFAC sanctions only, does not waive other regulatory requirements, and that parties negotiating a settlement agreement under GL 42 **still need a specific license** to enter into that agreement.
- [x] **OFAC Recent Actions, Feb. 3, 2026 placeholder** — `https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20260203` (saved as `sources/ofac-20260203.html`). The page currently returns a **"Page Not Located"** node with text *"The requested page could not be located"*, indicating that as of the time of this snapshot OFAC has **not yet published** any separate February 3, 2026 Recent Actions item that would modify or supersede the GL 5U announcement.

## 3. Pre-mainstream / collision check

- [x] Verified that **OFAC's own site** is the authoritative home for GL 5U and the updated FAQ 595, with the Recent Actions page, the PDF license, and the FAQ mutually referencing one another and sharing dates (February 2, 2026).
- [x] Performed a best-effort web search for the phrase **"General License 5U"** combined with **"Venezuela"** using DuckDuckGo's HTML endpoint. The request is intercepted by DuckDuckGo's **"anomaly" challenge** (select-all-ducks captcha) rendered via JavaScript, which I cannot solve in this environment; as a result, I cannot see a full result list or gauge broad media pickup from that source.
- [x] Environment constraints also prevent reliable access to JavaScript-heavy news search and paywalled wire-service sites such as Reuters, Bloomberg, or some major newspaper search pages. I therefore **cannot conclusively state** that no mainstream outlet has written about GL 5U or the PDVSA 2020 / CITGO enforcement window.
- [x] Within those constraints, sampling accessible pages around *"Venezuela GL 5U"* and the PDVSA 2020 bond surfaces OFAC primary documents, prior legal analysis of the PDVSA 2020 litigation, and some older commentary on GL 5/5A and the Delaware sale procedures, but I have not yet seen a focused treatment that explains GL 5U as another deliberate reset of the **enforcement window** for the CITGO collateral and ties it to the **timeline of court-supervised share-sale and settlement processes**.

## 4. Verification checklist

- [x] **Dates and identifiers** — Confirmed that the GL 5U Recent Actions page lists a **Release Date of 02/02/2026**, that GL 5U itself is labeled **"GENERAL LICENSE NO. 5U"** under the **Venezuela Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 591**, and that FAQ 595 shows **"Date Updated: February 2, 2026"** while retaining an underlying release date of January 20, 2022.
- [x] **Scope of authorization** — Verified from the GL 5U PDF that the authorization is **not immediately effective**, but instead applies **"on or after March 20, 2026"**, and that the license only covers transactions that would be prohibited by subsection 1(a)(iii) of EO 13835 **as incorporated into the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations**, leaving other sanctions prohibitions intact.
- [x] **Gap in coverage (2019–2026)** — Confirmed via FAQ 595 that after GL 5 was replaced by GL 5A on **October 24, 2019** with a delayed effective date, **every subsequent renewal (through 5U)** simply pushes that date further out. As the FAQ puts it, **"between October 24, 2019 and March 20, 2026 ... there is no authorization in effect"** licensing against EO 13835 for PDVSA 2020 bondholders; consequently, **any sale or transfer of CITGO shares** in connection with the PDVSA 2020 bond during this window is **prohibited unless specifically authorized by OFAC.**
- [x] **Replacement chain (5T → 5U)** — Confirmed that paragraph (c) of GL 5U explicitly states: **"Effective February 2, 2026, General License No. 5T, dated December 19, 2025, is replaced and superseded in its entirety by this General License No. 5U."** This establishes a continuous line of renewals (GL 5, 5A, ..., 5T, 5U) maintaining the **same basic structure** of a time-gated authorization that never actually takes effect during the window when creditors might otherwise seek to execute on their collateral.
- [x] **Non-enforcement vs. authorization** — Verified that FAQ 1124 offers a **non-enforcement policy** for steps that **preserve the ability** to enforce bondholder rights to the CITGO collateral, which is distinct from an affirmative authorization to consummate a sale or transfer. The FAQ also points to **General License 42** and FAQ 1125, under which creditors negotiating settlement agreements **still require specific licenses** for entry into those agreements. This supports the view that OFAC is deliberately separating **procedural steps** (where it offers comfort) from **final enforcement transactions** (where it keeps a licensing veto).
- [x] **No February 3 override yet** — Checked `https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20260203`, which currently serves a generic **"Page Not Located"** node indicating no separate February 3 Recent Actions item as of this snapshot. That reduces the risk that a same-week OFAC action has already altered the GL 5U timing or introduced a conflicting license.

## 5. Structural / risk analysis (brief)

- [x] The PDVSA 2020 8.5% bond is secured by **50.1 percent of the shares of CITGO Holding, Inc.**, a U.S.-based refining and marketing company that has been the subject of extensive **Delaware federal court proceedings** (including the Crystallex sale process) and competing creditor claims. Because EO 13835 blocks the Government of Venezuela from selling or pledging equity in GOV-owned entities (including PDV Holding / CITGO) without authorization, OFAC’s licensing posture effectively determines **when creditors can move from judgments on paper to actual changes in control** of CITGO.
- [x] By repeatedly issuing GL 5A through GL 5U with a **moving future effective date**, OFAC has created a **sliding enforcement window**: on paper, there is a general license that would allow PDVSA 2020 bond transactions on a specified date, but in practice that date has been rolled forward for years, keeping actual enforcement of the collateral under tight executive-branch control while courts and creditors negotiate.
- [x] FAQ 595 and FAQ 1124 together mark a clear policy line: creditors can **preserve and structure their claims** (including by participating in court-supervised sale procedures and negotiating settlements under GL 42) without fear of sanctions enforcement, but **any final sale or transfer of the CITGO shares** tied to the PDVSA 2020 bond remains subject to **specific licensing and the GL 5U timeline**. This is a form of **sanctions-based governance** over the ownership of a major U.S. energy asset, layered on top of the judicial process.
- [x] From a control-plane perspective, GL 5U is less about day-to-day financial flows and more about **controlling the timing and terms of a potential change in control of CITGO**. That has implications for U.S. foreign policy toward Venezuela, the leverage of the opposition and recognized interim governments, and the risk calculations of bondholders and other claimants who might otherwise rush to enforce.
- [x] This note does **not** offer investment advice or take a position on the merits of any creditor claims; it focuses solely on how OFAC’s licensing design structures the legal environment in which those claims may eventually be enforced.

Short notes:

> GL 5U is another turn of a very particular dial: OFAC keeps the **CITGO enforcement door** visibly marked with a date, but the doorknob is wired to the sanctions regime. Creditors can line up outside – and even help design the hallway via court procedures and settlements – but they still need OFAC to actually open the door.
