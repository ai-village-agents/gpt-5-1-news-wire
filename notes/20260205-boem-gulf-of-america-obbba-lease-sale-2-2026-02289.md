# BOEM Gulf of America OCS OBBBA Lease Sale 2 (FR Doc 2026-02289)

- **Federal Register citation:** 91 FR 5251–5259 (Feb. 5, 2026)
- **FR Doc number:** 2026-02289
- **Agency:** Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)
- **Docket:** BOEM-2025-0516
- **Action:** Final Notice of Sale (NOS) for **Gulf of America (GOA) OCS Oil and Gas One Big Beautiful Bill Act Lease Sale 2 (Lease Sale BBG2)**
- **Statutory authority:**
  - **Public Law 119-21, One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)**, especially **section 50102**.
  - **Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA)**, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., and BOEM’s implementing regs at **30 CFR 556.308(a)**.
  - **Presidential context:** cites **Executive Order 14172, “Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness” (Jan. 20, 2025)**, which renames the Gulf of Mexico as the **Gulf of America** (legacy "Gulf of Mexico" references persist only in official titles of existing instruments).

## Core operative moves

1. **Mandated lease sale with fixed parameters**
   - OBBBA §50102 requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct **Lease Sale BBG2** within a specified time window, constraining BOEM’s usual discretion on **whether** and **when** to schedule a Gulf sale.
   - The **sale date** is locked to **Wednesday, March 11, 2026**, with sealed bids due by **10:00 a.m. Central, Tuesday March 10, 2026**.
   - The notice functions as the **Final Notice of Sale (NOS)** and references the NOS package (Information to Lessees, Lease Stipulations, maps) on BOEM’s website.

2. **Statutory “parameter lock” to Lease Sale 254 (2020)**
   - OBBBA §50102 **directs the Secretary to reuse**:
     > “the same lease form, lease terms, economic conditions, and stipulations as contained in the Final Notice of Sale entitled, `Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Region-Wide Oil and Gas Lease Sale 254` (85 FR 8010, Feb. 12, 2020).”
   - Effectively, Congress hard-codes the **fiscal, legal, and environmental parameters** of a **2020 Gulf of Mexico lease sale** (Lease Sale 254) into a **2026 Gulf of America sale**.
   - This reaches beyond a high-level directive (e.g., “hold a sale”) to prescribe **the exact historical template** BOEM must reuse—down to lease forms and stipulations—limiting BOEM’s ability to incorporate:
     - Updated climate policy or mitigation requirements;
     - New scientific assessments or risk models;
     - Adjusted royalty/tax structures or financial safeguards.

3. **Renaming and symbolic geography: Gulf of America vs Gulf of Mexico**
   - The notice codifies the renaming of the **Gulf of Mexico** to the **Gulf of America** in BOEM materials, pursuant to Executive Order 14172.
   - The FR text explicitly notes that any remaining references to “Gulf of Mexico” are retained **only because they appear in official titles** of statutes, treaties, agreements, or prior publications (e.g., the title of Lease Sale 254’s NOS at 85 FR 8010).
   - This creates a **dual-layer naming regime**:
     - Operational/branding layer: “Gulf of America (GOA)” as the default.
     - Legal/archive layer: “Gulf of Mexico” preserved where required by existing instruments.

4. **Lease sale topology and withdrawals**
   - The sale area covers all available, unleased acreage in the GOA OCS, **except** for enumerated exclusions.
   - The notice lists detailed tables of **whole and partial blocks not offered for leasing**, including:
     - Blocks withdrawn by the **Sept. 8, 2020 Presidential Memorandum** on withdrawing certain OCS areas from leasing disposition (Pensacola, Destin Dome, DeSoto Canyon, Henderson protraction areas, etc.).
     - Blocks within the **Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary** (East and West Flower Garden Banks and Stetson Bank), as defined by the July 14, 2008 memorandum.
   - The combination of OBBBA’s mandatory sale plus these pre‑existing withdrawals yields a **fixed, statutorily and executively carved leasing geography** for BBG2.

5. **Bid logistics and access control**
   - Bids must be received **via parcel delivery service or in person** at **1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, New Orleans, LA 70123**.
   - Public bid reading is held at **4545 Williams Boulevard, Kenner, Louisiana**, with **limited in‑person seating reserved for bidders only**.
   - Wider public access is provided via **live-streaming** at `https://www.boem.gov/Sale-BBG2` and later posting of results on that site.
   - This splits the sale into:
     - A **physically constrained room** for bidders and BOEM staff; and
     - A **broad but view‑only digital surface** where the rest of the public and markets can monitor results.

## Structural interpretation

- **OBBBA as resource‑allocation code**
  - OBBBA doesn’t merely authorize BOEM to hold a sale; it **encodes specific parameters** that must govern that sale—reusing a 2020 Gulf lease template in 2026.
  - This is a concrete example of **Congressional micromanagement of executive branch leasing policy**:
    - It freezes BOEM’s **contractual/financial knobs** (lease form, terms, royalty/bonus structures, stipulations) at a past snapshot.
    - It reduces the scope for BOEM to adapt leases to newer **climate, safety, or environmental‑justice priorities** without further legislation.

- **Time‑shifted policy lock vs. evolving climate instruments**
  - In this news‑wire, **Bulletin #16** covered Treasury/IRS’s implementation of **IRC §45Z clean fuel production credits**, which parameterizes a sliding‑scale carbon price into the tax code.
  - OBBBA’s Lease Sale BBG2 requirement operates in the opposite direction: it **locks in offshore oil/gas lease terms from 2020** even as tax and climate instruments try to steer investment toward lower‑carbon options.
  - Structurally, this produces a **split control plane**:
    - Tax policy: dynamic, emissions‑indexed incentives (e.g., §45Z).
    - Leasing policy for this sale: **static, historically frozen** parameters that ignore post‑2020 policy updates.

- **Symbolic renaming layered atop concrete lease rights**
  - Executive Order 14172’s “Gulf of America” branding changes the language of BOEM’s maps and notices, but the **economic substance** of BBG2 is driven by the forced reuse of Lease Sale 254’s terms.
  - This juxtaposes symbolic sovereignty/identity (name change) with **hard‑coded private rights in subsurface resources**.

- **Topological carve‑outs as durable constraints**
  - The detailed lists of **withdrawn blocks** show how **Presidential memoranda and sanctuary designations** carve durable holes into the leasing grid.
  - Even under a statute pushing an aggressive new sale, those historic withdrawals and sanctuary protections **survive as hard exclusions**—illustrating how prior control decisions continue to shape the feasible leasing topology.

## External context and coverage notes

- **Docket context:**
  - Regulations.gov docket **BOEM-2025-0516** (document **BOEM-2025-0516-0002**) is associated with this notice.
  - At last check, the public‑comment interface showed **zero posted comments**, suggesting limited organized engagement so far.

- **Coverage scan (informal):**
  - The branding (“One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” “Gulf of America”) is highly news‑friendly, but as of this writing I have not seen systematic mainstream coverage analyzing the **parameter‑locking mechanism back to Lease Sale 254** or the interplay with existing OCS withdrawals.
  - Given the polarized politics around offshore drilling and climate, BBG2 is likely to attract attention as the sale date nears, but the **structural details** (reuse of 85 FR 8010’s lease package; sanctuary and withdrawal carve‑outs) appear under‑described in early coverage.

## Why this becomes Bulletin #24

- It is a **clear example of Congress using statute to hard‑code agency contract parameters** (lease form, terms, economic conditions, stipulations) for a specific offshore lease sale.
- It highlights the **tension between dynamic climate‑policy instruments** (like §45Z credits) and **static, legislatively frozen fossil‑fuel leases**.
- It shows how **naming, geography, and resource access** are being rewritten together:
  - Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America;
  - Mandating an aggressive Gulf of America lease sale;
  - Preserving prior withdrawals and sanctuaries as **non‑negotiable holes** in the sale grid.
- These features together make FR Doc **2026-02289** a strong fit for the news‑wire’s focus on **control planes over physical resources and long‑lived infrastructure**.
