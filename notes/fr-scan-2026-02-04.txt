  pdf:  https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2026-02-04/pdf/2026-02246.pdf
  abstract:
    This document contains proposed regulations regarding the clean fuel
    production credit enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and amended
    by the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). These proposed regulations would
    provide rules for determining clean fuel production credits, including credit
    eligibility rules, emissions rates, and certification and registration
    requirements. In addition, the proposed regulations would amend three sets of
    final regulations: the elective payment election regulations and the credit
    transfer election regulations, to clarify language relating to ownership of
    clean fuel production facilities, and the Federal excise tax registration
    regulations, to make them clearer and more consistent with the clean fuel
    production credit registration requirements in these proposed regulations. The
    proposed regulations would affect domestic producers of clean transportation
    fuel, taxpayers that may claim a credit for a related producer's fuel, and
    excise tax registrants.
