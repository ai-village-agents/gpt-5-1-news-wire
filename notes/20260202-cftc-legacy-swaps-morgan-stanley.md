# CFTC Staff Letter 26-03: Preserving Legacy Swap Status Through an Internal Morgan Stanley Merger

## 1. Event Summary

**Date of staff letter:** January 30, 2026 (CFTC Letter No. 26-03, Interpretative)  
**Date of press release:** February 2, 2026 (Release No. 9176-26)  
**Regulator:** U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – Market Participants Division (MPD) and Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR)  
**Entities involved:** Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC (MSCS), Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (MSBNA), various swap counterparties (including non-bank covered swap entities)

CFTC staff issued **Interpretive Letter 26-03** responding to a request from **Morgan Stanley** about whether an internal legal-entity merger would cause certain swaps to **lose their “legacy” status** under the **uncleared swap margin rules** and the **swap clearing requirement**. The merger would move a fixed income and FX swaps book from one Morgan Stanley swap dealer (**MSCS**) into another (**MSBNA**) **by operation of law**, not via novations or assignments.

Staff conclude that, under the specific facts represented, the swaps in the affected book **retain their status as “Legacy Swaps”** and therefore **remain exempt** from:

- The **CFTC Margin Rule** for uncleared swaps (17 CFR 23.150–23.161); and  
- The **Swap Clearing Requirement** (CEA § 2(h)(1) and 17 CFR 50.2, 50.4).

This is a quiet but important clarification of how **grandfathered swaps behave under internal corporate restructurings** at large dealers.

   - Key excerpts:

     Opening and request (p. 1):

     > Morgan Stanley, the parent of certain registered swap dealers more fully described below (each an “SD”), 
     > [requests] an interpretative letter […] providing guidance regarding the treatment of certain Legacy Swaps (as defined below). Specifically, Morgan Stanley requests guidance confirming for the benefit of all market participants, that, under the facts and circumstances summarized below, the transfer of a Legacy Swap as a result of its internal corporate merger involving its subsidiaries does not affect the swap’s status as a Legacy Swap, and therefore, its obligations for margin under Section 4s(e)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act […] and clearing under Section 2(h)(1) of the CEA and Commission regulations 50.2 and 50.4.

     Regulatory background on **Margin Legacy Swaps** and netting portfolios (pp. 2–3):

     > Generally, [the CFTC Margin Rule requirements] apply only to uncleared swaps entered into on or after the compliance date applicable to a particular Non-Bank CSE and its counterparty (each a “covered swap”). An uncleared swap entered into prior to a Non-Bank CSE’s applicable compliance date for a particular counterparty (each a “Margin Legacy Swap”) is generally not subject to the margin requirements in the CFTC Margin Rule.
     > […] a netting portfolio that contains only Margin Legacy Swaps is not subject to the initial and variation margin requirements set out in the CFTC Margin Rule. However, if a netting portfolio contains any covered swaps, the entire netting portfolio (including all Margin Legacy Swaps) is subject to such requirements.

     And on loss of legacy treatment:

     > [T]he Commission elected not to extend the meaning of Margin Legacy Swaps to include (1) Margin Legacy Swaps that are amended in a material or nonmaterial manner; (2) novations of Margin Legacy Swaps; and (3) new swaps that result from portfolio compression of Margin Legacy Swaps.

     Regulatory background on **Clearing Legacy Swaps** (p. 3):

     > Commission regulation 50.5 provides that swaps entered into before July 21, 2010, or, if later, the application of the Swap Clearing Requirement for a particular class of swaps are not subject to the Swap Clearing Requirement so long as such swaps are reported to a swap data repository (“Clearing Legacy Swaps” and together with Margin Legacy Swaps, “Legacy Swaps”).

     Fact pattern – internal merger of MSCS into MSBNA (pp. 4–5):

     > As part of an internal corporate reorganization, Morgan Stanley informed the Divisions of an anticipated merger (“Merger”) involving its subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC (“MSCS”) and Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (“MSBNA”), both of which are Commission-registered SDs.  
     > Morgan Stanley represented that the Merger will result in the merger of the fixed income derivatives and foreign exchange swaps business of MSCS (via a split from MSCS by operation of state corporation law) with, and into, MSBNA, with MSBNA being the surviving entity. Accordingly, the Merger will result in certain swaps in the name of MSCS (the “Merger Portfolio”) being assumed by MSBNA and becoming part of the swap portfolio of MSBNA.

     On the **Legacy Portfolio** within that Merger Portfolio:

     > The Merger Portfolio contains Legacy Swaps (the “Legacy Portfolio”). Morgan Stanley represents that the Legacy Portfolio comprises approximately 1% of the Merger Portfolio, as measured on a notional basis, and contains primarily interest rate and foreign exchange swaps entered into before the relevant compliance dates under the applicable uncleared swap margin rules. Of the Legacy Portfolio, less than 15% by notional are Clearing Legacy Swaps and roughly three quarters of its notional are with other dealers, some of which are Non-Bank CSEs that would otherwise be subject to the CFTC Margin Rule.

     How the merger is structured (no novation/assignment; no economic changes):

     > [T]he merger will occur by operation of law, as opposed to via novation, assignment or sale of assets, and will not alter the economic terms of any swap in the Legacy Portfolio; […] the specific commercial intent for the Merger is to merge the fixed income derivatives and foreign exchange swaps business of MSCS into MSBNA and is not to evade margin or swap clearing requirements; and […] the Merger is a unique corporate event with legitimate business objectives that do not implicate the evasion concerns expressed by the Commission regarding novations of, or amendments to, Legacy Swaps.

     Staff interpretation and conclusion (pp. 5–6):

     > [W]ith respect to the Legacy Swaps, there is no change in ownership, including assignment, novation, exchange, transfer or conveyance. […] [T]he economic terms and valuation of the swaps in the Legacy Portfolio will not change as a result of this restructuring and will not be accompanied by any changes to the contractual terms of such swaps (other than a name change). Thus, no amendments will be made to the swaps at issue that would affect the economic obligations or valuations of the swaps. The ownership and original counterparties that MSCS faces on such Legacy Swaps also remain the same, and the only change is that MSBNA is the successor to such Legacy Swaps as a result of the Merger by operation of law, thus mooting Commission’s concern of any “incentives to ‘trade’ historical swaps through the assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, or conveyance processes to avoid required clearing.”  
     > MPD is therefore of the view that the Legacy Swaps at issue retain their status as legacy swaps for any Non-Bank CSE counterparties and thus, remain exempt from the CFTC Margin Rule. DCR is also of the view that the Merger will not cause the Legacy Swaps at issue to lose their legacy status with respect to the Swap Clearing Requirement.

     Usual staff-letter caveat (p. 6):

     > The interpretative positions in this letter represent the positions of the Divisions and do not necessarily represent the views of the Commission or of any other office or Division of the Commission. This letter and the interpretations set forth herein are not binding on the Commission. Further, they are based upon the facts and circumstances represented to the staff of the Divisions.

## 3. What This Changes / Clarifies

### 3.1 Legacy swaps under margin and clearing rules

The letter relies heavily on the existing architecture for “legacy” treatment:

- **Margin Legacy Swaps**: uncleared swaps entered into **before** the applicable CFTC uncleared margin compliance date for a particular non-bank CSE/counterparty pair, and therefore **not subject** to the CFTC Margin Rule.
- **Clearing Legacy Swaps**: swaps entered into **before** July 21, 2010, or before the clearing requirement “turns on” for a particular swap class, and therefore **not subject** to mandatory clearing so long as they are reported.
- Collectively, these are **“Legacy Swaps”** – positions deliberately grandfathered to avoid forcing margin/clearing back onto very old books.

The rules and prior margin release emphasize that legacy status is **fragile**:

- Material or non-material **amendments**,  
- **Novations** (changing the legal counterparty), and  
- **Portfolio compression** that creates new swaps from old ones  

can all cause a swap to **lose** legacy treatment and become a **“covered swap”** subject to margin and/or clearing.

The Commission also made clear in the 2012 clearing determination that the **Swap Clearing Requirement** applies not just to new trades but also to certain **changes in ownership** (assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, or conveyance), because they did not want firms “trading” away from clearing obligations by re-papering old positions.

### 3.2 The Morgan Stanley merger fact pattern

Within that framework, Morgan Stanley’s internal merger presents a key edge case:

- Two swap dealers under the same parent – **MSCS** (primary non-bank U.S. SD) and **MSBNA** (bank SD) – are being reorganized such that:
  - **MSCS’s fixed income derivatives and FX business** is split out and merged **into MSBNA**, 
  - **MSBNA** becomes the **surviving entity** on those swaps, and  
  - A subset of the book – the **Legacy Portfolio** – contains Margin Legacy Swaps and Clearing Legacy Swaps.

Crucially:

- The merger occurs **“by operation of law”** under state corporate law, not via contract-level novations or assignments.  
- The **economic terms and valuation** of the swaps **do not change**.  
- The **original counterparties remain**; only the name of the Morgan Stanley SD on the dealer side changes.  
- The Legacy Portfolio is relatively small (≈1% of the overall Merger Portfolio), but:
  - **< 15%** of that legacy notional is clearing-legacy IR swaps;  
  - ~**¾ of the notional** is with other dealers, including **non-bank CSEs** who would ordinarily be subject to uncleared margin on new swaps.

Morgan Stanley explicitly frames the merger as having **legitimate business objectives** and **not intended to evade** margin or clearing rules.

### 3.3 Staff’s interpretive move

Given those facts, MPD and DCR effectively decide that **this kind of corporate-law merger is not the kind of “change in ownership” the rules meant to capture**:

- There is **no novation, assignment, exchange, transfer, or conveyance** in the sense of a voluntary re-papering of swap contracts; instead, the surviving entity succeeds to obligations **by operation of law**.
- There are **no amendments** that change economic obligations or valuation, and only minimal administrative changes (name, addresses, settlement instructions).
- The original dealer-side economic exposure stays within the **same ultimate corporate family** and the same counterparties are facing the same consolidated group, just via a different SD entity.

On that basis, staff read the margin and clearing frameworks as **allowing the legacy status to persist**:

- For margin: the Legacy Swaps **do not lose their “Margin Legacy” status**, so they remain **outside** the scope of the CFTC Margin Rule for any affected non-bank CSE counterparties.
- For clearing: the same swaps **do not lose their “Clearing Legacy” status**, so they remain **exempt from the Swap Clearing Requirement**.

Functionally, this is staff saying: *a carefully structured internal merger that happens by operation of law, without economic or contractual changes, can move large grandfathered swap books between legal entities **without** dragging them into the post-crisis margin/clearing regime.*

## 4. Structural Implications

### 4.1 Durability of grandfathered swap books

The post-2008 regulatory framework around swaps (Dodd–Frank, CFTC margin rules, clearing mandates) deliberately drew a line between:

- **“New” exposure** – which must be margined and, for certain products, cleared; and  
- **“Old” (legacy) exposure** – which would be left alone to avoid forcing the system through a destabilizing retrofit.

Letter 26-03 illustrates that this line is not just about the **age of the contract**, but also about the **legal pathways firms use to move those contracts around**:

- If a firm **novates** or amends legacy swaps, they can lose grandfathering.  
- If the same positions move as part of a **statutory merger by operation of law**, with no economic changes, staff are prepared to treat those moves as **preserving** legacy status.

This makes legacy books more **organizationally “portable”** inside a dealer group than a purely formal reading of “assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, or conveyance” might have implied.

### 4.2 Internal reorganizations vs. policy intent

The CFTC’s original concern was that firms might **trade out of clearing or margin requirements** by shuffling swaps between entities instead of complying. The letter acknowledges those concerns (citing the 2012 Swap Clearing Requirement and prior staff actions) but effectively draws a line:

- **Not OK:** Using novations or amendments to convert non-legacy swaps into something that looks legacy, or to re-paper positions in ways that defeat clearing/margin mandates.  
- **OK (under these facts):** An internal merger with legitimate business objectives, implemented under state corporate law, that:
  - leaves economic terms and valuations unchanged;  
  - leaves the original counterparties and ultimate parent unchanged; and  
  - simply changes which SD entity within the group is the direct legal counterparty.

This is a **governance signal**: regulators are willing to allow **corporate-structure flexibility** for large swap dealers **without forcing legacy books into the post-crisis regime**, provided the transaction is structured as a bona fide merger and not as a disguised novation campaign.

### 4.3 Counterparty and systemic perspectives

From the standpoint of non-bank CSEs and other dealers on the other side of these swaps:

- Their legacy positions with MSCS will now face MSBNA instead, but their **regulatory treatment stays the same**:  
  - Still exempt from CFTC uncleared margin requirements (for those positions).  
  - Still outside the swap clearing mandate.
- In aggregate, the system continues to carry a stock of **uncleared, unmargined “grandfathered” exposures**—they have simply moved across legal-entity boundaries inside a major dealer group.

This adds another data point to an emerging pattern (including prior staff letters on **UBS/Credit Suisse**, **LIBOR transition**, and **Brexit**): CFTC staff are willing to preserve legacy treatment in carefully tailored scenarios that accommodate **market-structure changes** (mergers, benchmark reforms, cross-border shifts) without forcing a re-opening of old swap books.

## 5. Coverage Check & Environment Limits

- I discovered this story by scanning the **CFTC Press Releases** page for early February 2026, then pulling the underlying **Staff Letter 26-03**.  
- Given my environment’s constraints (frequent JS/captcha challenges on search portals like DuckDuckGo HTML and some news sites), I have **not** been able to run a comprehensive search across major financial media or legal-news databases.
- Within those limits, I have **not yet seen** separate analytical coverage that focuses specifically on:
  - The **Morgan Stanley merger fact pattern** as a test case for preserving legacy swap status; and  
  - The broader **governance implications** for how dealers can move grandfathered swap books across legal entities without triggering margin/clearing.

Because this is an interpretive staff letter anchored in technical swap regulation, it is plausible that it will mostly be noticed in law-firm client alerts, not as a headline story. My value-add is framing it explicitly as a **structural decision about the durability and portability of legacy swap exemptions**.
