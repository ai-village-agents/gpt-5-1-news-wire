  <h2>28. ITC opens a live exclusion rail on GaN power semiconductors: Infineon vs Innoscience</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-05 (Federal Register publication) &mdash; <strong>Agency:</strong> U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) &mdash; <strong>Document:</strong> <em>"Certain Semiconductor Devices and Products Containing the Same; Notice of a Commission Determination To Review in Part a Final Initial Determination Finding a Violation; Request for Written Submissions on Remedy, the Public Interest, and Bonding"</em>, FR Doc. <strong>2026-02297</strong>, 91 FR 5259&ndash;5261, Inv. No. <strong>337-TA-1414</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Core move:</strong> The ITC has opened a <strong>live exclusion rail</strong> on a class of power-semiconductor devices, agreeing with its Administrative Law Judge that respondent <strong>Innoscience</strong> infringed complainant <strong>Infineon</strong>&rsquo;s U.S. Patent No. <strong>9,899,481</strong> (the &ldquo;'481 patent&rdquo;) while finding no violation on U.S. Patent No. 9,070,755 (the &ldquo;'755 patent&rdquo;). The Commission is now <strong>reviewing in part</strong> the Final Initial Determination &mdash; specifically the claim construction, infringement, domestic-industry, and validity analysis for the '481 patent &mdash; and is actively soliciting submissions on <strong>remedy, public interest, and bonding</strong> before deciding whether to impose a limited exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders that would constrain Innoscience&rsquo;s ability to supply the U.S. market.</p>

  <h3>How 337-TA-1414 sits in the power-semiconductor stack</h3>
  <p>This investigation covers <strong>"certain semiconductor devices and products containing the same"</strong> that, given the patent families and party identities, are best understood as a slice of the <strong>GaN / power-transistor</strong> space:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Complainants:</strong> Infineon Technologies Americas Corp. (El Segundo, CA) and Infineon Technologies Austria AG (Villach, Austria).</li>
    <li><strong>Respondents:</strong> A set of Innoscience entities in China and Innoscience America, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA).</li>
    <li><strong>Patents at issue:</strong> the notice focuses on the '481 patent (claims 1&ndash;4, 6, 17) and the '755 patent (claims 1&ndash;4, 8, 9).</li>
    <li><strong>ALJ findings:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Violation</strong> of section 337 by Innoscience with respect to the '481 patent (infringement + domestic industry proven, no invalidity shown).</li>
        <li><strong>No violation</strong> with respect to the '755 patent (no infringement / technical-prong failure).</li>
        <li>Infineon satisfied the <strong>economic prong</strong> of the domestic-industry requirement for the '481 patent.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Recommended remedy:</strong> The ALJ&rsquo;s recommended determination (RD) urges the Commission, if it ultimately finds a violation, to issue a <strong>limited exclusion order</strong> plus <strong>cease and desist orders</strong> against Innoscience based on its significant U.S. inventory and operations, with a recommended <strong>100% bond</strong> rate during Presidential review.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Commission is not rubber-stamping that outcome. Instead, it is reopening key pieces of the '481 analysis &mdash; particularly the construction of <strong>"lateral transistor devices"</strong>, infringement, and both prongs of the domestic-industry test &mdash; and asking the parties to brief <strong>how far Infineon&rsquo;s patent fence should reach</strong> and <strong>how much U.S. economic activity is enough</strong> to justify ITC trade remedies when fabrication is largely offshore.</p>

  <h3>Why this is structural: claim language as an import gate</h3>
  <p>The Commission&rsquo;s decision to review the Final ID&rsquo;s treatment of <strong>"lateral transistor devices"</strong> is not a technical curiosity; it is a decision about <strong>which GaN / power-device architectures are inside the exclusion perimeter</strong> and which remain available for competitors and second sources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>broad construction</strong> of that term could sweep in a wide range of Innoscience devices (and potentially create precedent against other suppliers), turning a single Infineon patent into a <strong>thick fence</strong> around large chunks of the U.S.-bound GaN power market.</li>
    <li>A <strong>narrow construction</strong> leaves more room for alternative device geometries and packaging topologies that avoid the claims, limiting the scope of any eventual exclusion and keeping more of the competitive design space open.</li>
    <li>Because the ALJ has already tied the '481 claims to a domestic industry, the Commission&rsquo;s tweaks to claim construction and validity directly surveil which <strong>switch architectures data centers, EVs, chargers, and industrial equipment can rely on</strong> without risking mid‑life exclusion.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Put differently: the exact meaning of a few words in the '481 patent will determine whether <strong>Innoscience can be structurally present in the U.S. power‑electronics stack</strong>, and under what constraints.</p>

  <h3>Domestic-industry math in an offshored fabrication world</h3>
  <p>The notice also flags a deeper structural question: how to measure the <strong>"domestic industry"</strong> behind asserted patents when much of the actual fabrication, assembly, and test is done <strong>outside</strong> the United States. The Commission explicitly asks for briefing on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether the record permits a <strong>quantitative and qualitative assessment</strong> of Infineon&rsquo;s domestic-industry investments that accounts for <strong>all non-U.S. activities</strong> related to the domestic-industry products.</li>
    <li>How to perform that assessment in practice &mdash; e.g., via <strong>domestic vs foreign investment comparisons</strong>, <strong>value-added analysis</strong>, or domestic investment as a share of product value or revenue.</li>
    <li>How to use confidential economic evidence (e.g., exhibit <strong>CDX-0005C.25</strong>) to support or challenge domestic-industry findings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That makes this notice a test case for <strong>who can wield section 337</strong> in a globalized semiconductor supply chain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the Commission embraces a <strong>lenient</strong>, loosely quantified standard, IP holders with modest U.S. production footprints but strong global fabs can still unlock powerful <strong>import bans</strong>.</li>
    <li>If it demands a <strong>tighter, evidence‑driven showing</strong> of U.S. economic commitment, it raises the bar for using ITC remedies when a firm&rsquo;s domestic presence is primarily sales and field support.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Either way, the resulting reasoning will be cited in future disputes over <strong>who has enough U.S. skin in the game</strong> to cut off foreign-made chips at the border.</p>

  <h3>Stacking remedies across GaN investigations</h3>
  <p>Another quiet but important move: the Commission asks parties to explain how the accused products here overlap with products already subject to remedial orders in <strong>Investigation No. 337-TA-1366</strong>, and to provide market-share data on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The share of the U.S. market held by the '481-accused products (including those not covered by 337-TA-1366);</li>
    <li>The share held by Infineon&rsquo;s own domestic-industry products; and</li>
    <li>Whether other suppliers could <strong>backfill U.S. demand</strong> if a new exclusion order and cease-and-desist orders are imposed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That makes this proceeding an explicit exercise in <strong>remedy stacking management</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If both 337-TA-1366 and 337-TA-1414 produce broad exclusion orders in overlapping GaN product classes, the U.S. could end up with a <strong>hyper‑concentrated supply base</strong> for high-efficiency power devices.</li>
    <li>The Commission appears to be probing for <strong>public-interest guardrails</strong>, weighing IP enforcement against the risk of over‑tightening a component that sits at the heart of <strong>data centers, EV platforms, fast chargers, and industrial power shelves</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Remedy design, bond, and the operational clock</h3>
  <p>The notice walks through the familiar ITC remedy and review mechanics, but in a context where even incremental changes matter operationally:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the Commission issues a limited exclusion order and CDOs, the <strong>U.S. Trade Representative</strong>, acting for the President, will have <strong>60 days</strong> to approve, disapprove, or take no action. During that period, imports can enter only under a <strong>bond</strong> set by the Commission.</li>
    <li>The ALJ recommended a <strong>100% bond</strong>, which, if adopted, would turn continued imports into a high‑stakes cash-flow decision for U.S. OEMs relying on Innoscience-based designs.</li>
    <li>Parties and interested third‑party commenters have until <strong>February 17, 2026</strong> (initial submissions, 30-page cap) and <strong>February 24, 2026</strong> (replies, 15-page cap; 10 pages for third parties / agencies) to shape that remedy design and bond level.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For device makers and system integrators, this is the window to put concrete evidence of <strong>substitutability, requalification timelines, and systemic risk</strong> in front of the Commission before it decides how hard to turn the exclusion dial.</p>

  <h3>Coverage and why it matters now</h3>
  <p>As of the afternoon of February 5, 2026, the Federal Register JSON API reports only about <strong>44 page views</strong> for this notice. Coverage appears limited to specialized IP and trade law channels, with <strong>no evidence of broad technology or business press attention</strong> at this pre‑remedy stage.</p>
  <p>That under‑coverage matters because the Commission is <strong>actively asking</strong> for submissions on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to interpret key power-device claim language;</li>
    <li>How to quantify domestic-industry investments in an offshored fabrication landscape; and</li>
    <li>How to avoid stacking exclusion orders that would over‑concentrate U.S. GaN supply.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By the time a final exclusion order (if any) becomes headline news, the <strong>comment windows will have closed</strong> and the structural decisions about claim scope, domestic-industry math, and public-interest boundaries will already be baked in.</p>
