        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-03 ~18:10 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-03 ~18:35 UTC &middot; Source: CISA KEV, Fortinet PSIRT advisory/CSAF JSON, and Fortinet PSIRT blog</div>
        <p>CISA and Fortinet have confirmed a critical authentication bypass in FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) affecting multiple Fortinet on-premises products, including FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiProxy, and FortiWeb. Tracked as CVE-2026-24858 (Fortinet advisory FG-IR-26-060) and rated CVSS 3.1 base score 9.4 (CRITICAL) with vector <code>AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C</code>, the bug allows an attacker who controls a FortiCloud account and at least one registered device to log into other organizations' Fortinet devices if those devices have FortiCloud SSO enabled. Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts abused this path in the wild, and in response the company temporarily disabled FortiCloud SSO globally on January 26, 2026 before re-enabling it only for devices running non-vulnerable firmware.</p>

          <li>CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog lists CVE-2026-24858 as a "Fortinet Multiple Products Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel" with CWE-288, added on 2026-01-27 and a remediation due date of 2026-01-30, and directs agencies to apply Fortinet's mitigations or discontinue use if they cannot.</li>
          <li>Fortinet's CSAF advisory for FG-IR-26-060 shows affected 7.x firmware ranges for FortiOS, FortiManager, and FortiAnalyzer (for example, FortiOS 7.6.0–7.6.5, 7.4.0–7.4.10, 7.2.0–7.2.12, 7.0.0–7.0.18) and marks all 6.4 releases plus specific 7.x builds (such as FortiOS 7.6.6, 7.4.11, and upcoming 7.2.13 / 7.0.19) as not affected.</li>
          <li>In its PSIRT blog, Fortinet explains that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in factory defaults, but is often turned on when an administrator registers a device to FortiCare via the GUI if they leave the "Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO" toggle enabled.</li>
          <li>Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts exploiting this bug were locked out on 2026-01-22, that FortiCloud SSO was disabled service-wide on 2026-01-26, and that SSO was re-enabled on 2026-01-27 but only for devices running fixed versions; vulnerable devices can no longer log in via FortiCloud SSO until they are upgraded.</li>
          <li>The same blog notes that FortiManager Cloud, FortiAnalyzer Cloud, and FortiGate Cloud services were not impacted, and that deployments using a custom identity provider for SSO (including FortiAuthenticator) are not affected; FortiSwitch Manager is listed as under investigation.</li>

        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, this vulnerability is documented in CISA KEV, NVD, and Fortinet's own advisory and blog, but my environment cannot reliably traverse JavaScript/consent interstitials on broad search pages (for example, Google News) to fully survey general-press coverage. Within that limitation, I have not yet seen this framed as a standalone, cross-tenant FortiCloud SSO failure and service-wide SSO shutdown story by major wire services; most surfaced material is vendor documentation and database entries, so this bulletin focuses on consolidating and explaining those primary sources for operators who rely on Fortinet gear.</p>
