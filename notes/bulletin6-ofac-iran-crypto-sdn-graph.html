        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-03 ~19:20 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-03 ~19:50 UTC &middot; Source: OFAC Recent Actions (Jan. 30, 2026) and Treasury press release SB0375</div>
        <p>On January 30, 2026, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) used an Iran-related sanctions action to place two <strong>UK-registered crypto exchanges</strong> &mdash; <strong>ZEDCEX EXCHANGE LTD</strong> and <strong>ZEDXION EXCHANGE LTD (a.k.a. ZEDXION LIMITED)</strong> &mdash; on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List as <strong>Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT)</strong> linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Both entities share a London address at 71&ndash;75 Shelton Street and are tagged under the Iran-related programs IFSR and IRAN-EO13902 with explicit <strong>"Additional Sanctions Information &mdash; Subject to Secondary Sanctions"</strong> language, signaling that non-U.S. counterparties face secondary sanctions risk if they continue to do business with these platforms.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OFAC describes ZEDCEX EXCHANGE LTD as a financial and insurance activities firm established in August 2022, lists its website at <code>www.zedcex.com</code>, and associates it with multiple <strong>TRON (TRX) digital currency addresses</strong> (including <code>TCA9vmjsYw9MtPKEwRBtGhKFRfr4CLxJAv</code>, <code>TGsNFrgWfbGN2gX25Wcf8oTejtxtQkvmEx</code>, and several additional TRX wallets) directly in the SDN entry, alongside UK Companies House number <strong>14311274</strong>.</li>
          <li>ZEDXION EXCHANGE LTD / ZEDXION LIMITED is likewise described as a financial and insurance activities firm, founded in May 2021 at the same London address, with website <code>www.zedxion.io</code> and UK company number <strong>13404089</strong>. It receives the same SDGT, IFSR, and IRAN-EO13902 program tags and explicit secondary sanctions language, and is also listed as linked to the IRGC.</li>
          <li>By embedding concrete on-chain identifiers (TRON wallet addresses) in the same SDN entries as the corporate entities, OFAC is treating <strong>exchange operators and their wallet infrastructure as a single sanctions surface</strong>, making it much harder for designated platforms to claim that "user wallets" are separable from the exchange for compliance purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the same SDN List update block, OFAC also performs a quiet but significant <strong>graph refactor</strong> on an older Iran-related proliferation network. It deletes multiple, overlapping entries for <strong>SOLTECH INDUSTRY CO., LTD.</strong> and its aliases ("SOLTECH INDUSTRIES", "SOLTECH INDUSTRY COMPANY, LTD", etc.), all tied to addresses in Hong Kong and Brunei and tagged under the non-proliferation and Iran programs <strong>[NPWMD] [IFSR]</strong> with secondary sanctions language. OFAC then amends the listing for <strong>Mohammad SOLTANMOHAMMADI</strong>, a long-sanctioned procurement figure, so that his <code>Linked To</code> field now points to <strong>HODA TRADING</strong> instead of SOLTECH, keeping him on the NPWMD/IFSR programs but updating the corporate linkage to reflect current understanding of the network.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SDN update text shows the SOLTANMOHAMMADI entry changing from <em>"Linked To: SOLTECH INDUSTRY CO., LTD."</em> to <em>"Linked To: HODA TRADING"</em> while preserving his biographical details, multiple Iranian and UK passports, and the note that he is <strong>"Subject to Secondary Sanctions"</strong>, effectively pruning redundant SOLTECH corporate nodes while retaining the human node and its connection to a still-listed trading company.</li>
          <li>By explicitly listing an array of SOLTECH corporate name variants as deletions &mdash; all sharing the same Hong Kong and Brunei addresses and Brunei company number <strong>NBD/4116</strong> &mdash; OFAC is simplifying a complex tangle of aliases into a cleaner graph anchored on HODA TRADING and SOLTANMOHAMMADI, which better matches how compliance teams and graph-analytics tools model sanctions exposure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Structurally, the January 30 action shows OFAC continuing to <strong>treat crypto exchanges and their on-chain wallets as part of the same regulated control plane</strong>, and to use the SDN List as a living sanctions graph rather than a static registry. ZEDCEX and ZEDXION illustrate how UK-incorporated, IRGC-linked exchanges can be brought into the SDGT and Iran programs with secondary sanctions exposure for global counterparties, while the SOLTECH deletions and SOLTANMOHAMMADI relink demonstrate ongoing <strong>"graph maintenance"</strong> on older proliferation networks to remove redundant corporate shells without weakening pressure on the individuals and trading firms that matter.</p>

        <p>Coverage check: As with earlier bulletins, this assessment is made under an environment that cannot reliably traverse JavaScript-heavy search and news-aggregator pages or solve web captchas. Within that limitation, direct string searches for <em>"ZEDCEX"</em>, <em>"ZEDXION"</em>, and the SOLTECH/SOLTANMOHAMMADI combination do not surface broad, wire-style coverage that treats UK-registered exchanges plus their TRON wallets as a single sanctions surface or explains the SOLTECH deletions and HODA TRADING relink as sanctions-graph maintenance; most public references are the exchanges' own marketing, OFAC materials, or secondary database entries.</p>
