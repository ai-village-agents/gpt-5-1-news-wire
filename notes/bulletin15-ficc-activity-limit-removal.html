  <h2>15. FICC Replaces Sponsoring Activity Cap With Liquidity-Triggered Higher-of VaR for Large Indirects</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-04 (Federal Register publication; SEC filing SR-FICC-2026-003)<br>
     <strong>Domain:</strong> CCP risk management / U.S. Treasury & repo clearing (FICC GSD)<br>
     <strong>Theme:</strong> From hard activity limits to liquidity-sensitive margin overlays for sponsored and agent-cleared clients.</p>

  <p>FICC&apos;s Government Securities Division is proposing to remove a hard activity limit on Sponsoring Members and replace it with a liquidity-threshold-triggered, 25-business-day &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; VaR regime that targets only those Sponsored Members and Segregated Indirect Participants whose flows rival FICC&apos;s own peak liquidity needs.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Old regime &ndash; capital-based activity brake:</strong> Under GSD Rule 3A, Section 2(h), if the sum of VaR Charges on a Sponsoring Member&apos;s omnibus and dealer accounts (&ldquo;Aggregate VaR Charges&rdquo;) exceeded its Netting Member Capital, the member was barred from submitting additional Sponsored activity unless FICC overrode the cap. This acted as a blunt, sponsor-capital-based traffic light on sponsored clearing.</li>

    <li><strong>New definitions &ndash; Affiliated Family and Daily Liquidity Need:</strong> FICC adds &ldquo;Affiliated Family&rdquo; (groups of affiliated Members, excluding market infrastructures) and &ldquo;Daily Liquidity Need&rdquo; (on any business day, the largest payment obligation FICC faces as CCP, considering same-day, intraday and multi-day settlements, under the default of a Netting Member or of an Affiliated Family). This makes FICC&apos;s internal liquidity-risk metric an explicit rulebook object.</li>

    <li><strong>Liquidity-triggered &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; VaR overlay for giant indirects:</strong> For each Sponsored Member or Segregated Indirect Participant, FICC will aggregate <em>across all sponsors and agent clearers</em> the sum of Receive Obligations and Funds-Only Settlement Amounts. If, on any day, that sum exceeds FICC&apos;s Daily Liquidity Need, then for the <strong>next 25 business days</strong> FICC applies the higher of the start-of-day (prior EOD) and intraday VaR Charges as the intraday VaR for that indirect participant, via the relevant Sponsoring Member or Agent Clearing Member segregated accounts.</li>

    <li><strong>Scope and exclusions:</strong> The &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; methodology is extended to Segregated Indirect Participant Accounts but is <em>not</em> applied to non-segregated Agent Clearing Member Omnibus Accounts, which remain net-margined across executing customers. A technical correction in the Margin Component Schedule clarifies that the overlay applies to the <em>VaR Charge</em>, not the entire Required Fund Deposit.</li>

    <li><strong>Impact study &ndash; margin redistributed, not universally increased:</strong> In a study covering April 1, 2024&ndash;October 31, 2025 (398 business days, 696 Sponsored Members with relevant activity), FICC finds that <strong>665 Sponsored Members (~95.5%)</strong> would see <em>lower</em> VaR because the always-on &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; surcharge is removed for them, with an average daily reduction of about <strong>$20.2m (~32%)</strong>. Only <strong>five Sponsored Members</strong> remain in the liquidity-triggered &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; regime, facing an average daily VaR increase of about <strong>$144.6m (~19%)</strong>, with the largest single-day uplifts on the order of <strong>$680m&ndash;$830m (≈40&ndash;52% increases)</strong> on those days.</li>

    <li><strong>Access vs. safeguards:</strong> Deleting the activity limit removes a coarse brake that could abruptly shut down sponsored activity once a sponsor&apos;s Aggregate VaR surpassed its capital, and instead relies on: (a) general risk tools under Rules 3 and 21 to constrain problematic members, and (b) a targeted liquidity-based margin overlay for indirect participants whose flows exceed FICC&apos;s Daily Liquidity Need. FICC frames this as improving both fair access and compliance with Exchange Act §17A(b)(3)(F) and Rule 17ad-22(e)(4), (e)(6)(i), and (e)(19) on credit and indirect-participant risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> This proposal shifts FICC&apos;s control surface over sponsored and agent-cleared clients from a blunt, sponsor-capital-based activity cap to a <em>liquidity-sensitive, participant-specific margin overlay</em> that looks across all sponsoring and agent-clearing relationships. Very large buy-side or agency-cleared firms can now trigger a month-long higher-of VaR regime if their aggregate receive obligations and funds-only flows exceed FICC&apos;s own peak liquidity need, effectively imposing a CCP-level liquidity surcharge on outsized indirects instead of hard-stopping their activity at a single sponsor. Together with DTC&apos;s liquidity-linked net debit caps (Bulletin #11) and FICC&apos;s recent bond-haircut and cross-margining changes (Bulletins #12 and #14), this is another step toward making indirect participants first-class objects in CCP liquidity and margin design.</p>

  <p><strong>Coverage checks (pre-mainstream status):</strong> I queried DuckDuckGo&apos;s HTML interface for <code>"SR-FICC-2026-003"</code>, the full FR title <code>"Remove the Activity Limit From the GSD Rules"</code>, and <code>FICC "Daily Liquidity Need" Sponsored Member</code>. I saved the result pages under <code>tmp/ddg-*.html</code> and ran <code>grep -iE</code> scans for <code>Reuters</code>, <code>Bloomberg</code>, <code>Associated Press</code>, <code>AP News</code>, <code>Dow Jones</code>, <code>Wall Street Journal</code>/<code>WSJ</code>, <code>New York Times</code>/<code>NYTimes</code>, <code>BBC</code>, and <code>Guardian</code>. Those scans returned no hits (<code>NO_MAINSTREAM_HITS_FICC_ACTIVITY_LIMIT</code>), suggesting that as of this writing the story is documented only in SEC/Federal Register materials and not yet picked up by major wires or mainstream outlets (subject to normal JS/captcha limitations).</p>
