  <h2>16. Section 45Z Turns U.S. Clean Fuel Credit Into a Sliding-Scale Carbon Price for North American Producers</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-04 (Federal Register proposed regulations)<br>
     <strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service; Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit; elective payment and transferability under sections 6417 and 6418<br>
     <strong>Theme:</strong> Treasury and IRS propose detailed rules that turn Section 45Z into a <em>performance-indexed production credit</em> for transportation fuels, tying dollar payouts to lifecycle emissions against a statutory baseline while locking eligible projects into North American supply chains and non-foreign-controlled ownership structures.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Credit mechanics – emissions factor times an “applicable amount”:</strong> Section 45Z sets a statutory baseline lifecycle emissions rate of <strong>50 kg CO₂e per mmBTU</strong>. A fuel’s <em>emissions factor</em> is the fractional improvement versus that baseline, calculated as <code>(50 − emissions rate) ÷ 50</code> and rounded to the nearest 0.1. The proposed regulations apply this factor to a per-gallon <strong>applicable amount</strong> to determine the credit: roughly, <code>45Z credit = applicable amount × gallons × emissions factor</code>. With prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) requirements met, the alternative amount reaches about <strong>$1.00/gal for non‑SAF fuels</strong> and <strong>$1.75/gal for SAF</strong> through 2025, inflation‑indexed thereafter, creating a linear carbon‑performance scale embedded in the tax code.</li>

    <li><strong>Lifecycle emissions tables as a live control surface:</strong> Emissions rates (in kg CO₂e/mmBTU) come either from an annual <strong>emissions rate table</strong> the Secretary publishes for types of transportation fuel, or from a <strong>Provisional Emissions Rate (PER)</strong> determination. Those rates must be based on lifecycle greenhouse gas methodology tied to <strong>Clean Air Act §211(o)(1)(H)</strong>, and may not be less than zero for post‑2025 production (except certain animal‑manure fuels). Because the emissions factor – and thus the size of the credit – depends directly on these tables, Treasury’s lifecycle modeling choices become a recurring <strong>policy lever</strong> for steering capital toward or away from specific fuel pathways without changing the statutory per‑gallon amounts.</li>

    <li><strong>Eligibility, geography, and foreign‑influence filters:</strong> To claim 45Z, the taxpayer must produce transportation fuel in the <strong>United States (including territories)</strong>, be <strong>registered as a producer under section 4101</strong>, and sell the fuel to an unrelated person in a qualified sale. For fuel produced after <strong>December 31, 2025</strong>, the feedstock must be produced or grown in the <strong>U.S., Mexico, or Canada</strong>, effectively constraining subsidized supply chains to North America. In addition, taxpayers that are <strong>specified foreign entities</strong> are barred for tax years beginning after <strong>July 4, 2025</strong>, and those that are broader <strong>foreign‑influenced entities</strong> (with a narrow statutory exception) are barred for years beginning after <strong>July 4, 2027</strong>. The result is a clean‑fuel production subsidy that is explicitly conditioned on both <em>geography</em> and <em>ownership/control</em>, turning eligibility into an industrial‑policy and national‑security filter.</li>

    <li><strong>Anti‑stacking with 45V, 45Q, and 48 makes credit identity a design decision:</strong> The regulations define a “qualified facility” as one used to produce transportation fuels but exclude any facility that, in the same year, claims (via section 38) the <strong>45V clean hydrogen credit</strong>, the relevant portion of the <strong>section 48 energy credit</strong> through a <strong>48(a)(15)</strong> election on a specified clean hydrogen facility, or the <strong>45Q carbon oxide sequestration credit</strong>. The preamble groups these as “anti‑stacking credits”. Project sponsors therefore must choose whether a facility lives under **45Z** or under **45V/45Q/48**, and that choice determines which regime governs its cash‑flow profile and default assumptions. This forces clean‑energy developers, tax‑equity investors, and offtakers to treat “credit identity” as a core structural design parameter for each site rather than layering multiple IRA credits on the same production.</li>

    <li><strong>Two‑layer governance of production vs monetization:</strong> The proposed rules emphasize that every business with a separate EIN (including disregarded entities and QSubs) must be separately registered under <strong>section 4101</strong> as a producer of clean fuel, aligning 45Z registration with existing excise‑tax regimes. By contrast, elections for <strong>elective payment (section 6417)</strong> or <strong>credit transferability (section 6418)</strong> are made by the upstream taxpayer that owns those entities, not by the disregarded facility‑level entity itself. That split creates a two‑layer control plane: the IRS can supervise <strong>operational compliance and measurement</strong> at the facility level via 4101 registration, while separately overseeing how consolidated groups <strong>cash out or sell</strong> the resulting 45Z streams via 6417/6418. In effect, lifecycle‑weighted carbon performance at a plant is being turned into a portable, financeable asset at the group level.</li>

    <li><strong>Timing, common storage, and trade flows:</strong> The credit is available only in the tax year of the <strong>qualified sale</strong>, not the year of production, and is disallowed for transportation fuel produced before <strong>January 1, 2025</strong>. Detailed examples show how gallons from multiple facilities commingled in common storage must be <strong>allocated pro rata</strong> back to each facility’s production for credit purposes, with their respective emissions factors and PWA status. This preserves the link between physical production, lifecycle performance, and the location and employment conditions of the facility, even when actual supply chains are pooled in tanks and pipelines.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> These regulations operationalize Section 45Z as a <strong>sliding‑scale carbon price for transportation fuels, paid out through the tax system</strong>. By tying the credit linearly to lifecycle emissions versus a fixed baseline, and then overlaying North American feedstock rules, foreign‑influence exclusions, and anti‑stacking with 45V/45Q/48, Treasury and IRS are defining not just who gets a subsidy, but which <em>production geographies, ownership structures, and technology stacks</em> will anchor the next decade of clean‑fuel infrastructure. At the same time, the split between facility‑level 4101 registration and group‑level 6417/6418 elections turns these performance‑weighted credits into financial instruments that can be monetized or transferred, while keeping the lifecycle‑emissions tables themselves as a live lever for future policy adjustments.</p>

  <p><strong>Coverage checks (pre‑mainstream status):</strong> I used DuckDuckGo&apos;s HTML search interface to query <code>"Section 45Z" "Clean Fuel Production Credit" Federal Register</code> and <code>"2026-02246" "Section 45Z"</code>. For each result page (saved under <code>tmp/ddg-45z-clean-fuel.html</code> and <code>tmp/ddg-45z-2026-02246.html</code>), I scanned the HTML with <code>grep -HiE</code> for <code>Reuters</code>, <code>Bloomberg</code>, <code>Associated Press</code>, <code>AP News</code>, <code>Dow Jones</code>, <code>Wall Street Journal</code>/<code>WSJ</code>, <code>New York Times</code>/<code>NYTimes</code>, <code>BBC</code>, and <code>Guardian</code>. These scans returned no matches (<code>NO_MAINSTREAM_HITS_45Z_CLEAN_FUEL</code> and <code>NO_MAINSTREAM_HITS_45Z_2026_02246</code>), so within an environment that cannot solve JavaScript-heavy captchas I treat this as a documented but under‑covered structural rulemaking on the tax and carbon‑pricing architecture for fuels.</p>
