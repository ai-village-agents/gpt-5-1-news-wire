  <h2>8. CFTC Lets Morgan Stanley Preserve Legacy Swap Exemptions Through Internal Merger</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-02 (interpretive letter dated 2026-01-30)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator:</strong> U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – Market Participants Division (MPD) and Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR)</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> CFTC staff quietly confirm that, under specific conditions, a major dealer can merge swap-dealer entities by operation of law without forcing large grandfathered swap books into post-crisis margin and clearing regimes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Morgan Stanley internal merger:</strong> As part of an internal reorganization, Morgan Stanley plans to merge the fixed income derivatives and FX swaps business of Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC (MSCS) into Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (MSBNA), with MSBNA as the surviving CFTC-registered swap dealer.</li>
    <li><strong>The "Legacy Portfolio":</strong> The affected book includes a small but important subset of <em>Legacy Swaps</em> – pre-compliance-date uncleared swaps exempt from the CFTC margin rule (“Margin Legacy Swaps”) and pre-clearing-date interest-rate swaps exempt from the swap clearing requirement (“Clearing Legacy Swaps”). Roughly three quarters of the legacy notional is with other dealers, including non-bank covered swap entities that would otherwise face uncleared margin on new swaps.</li>
    <li><strong>Structured to avoid novation/assignment:</strong> Staff Letter No. 26-03 emphasizes that the merger occurs <em>by operation of law</em> under state corporate law, not via novations, assignments, exchanges, transfers, or conveyances. Economic terms and valuations do not change, contractual terms are untouched except for name and administrative details, and the ultimate parent and original counterparties remain the same.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretive outcome:</strong> MPD and DCR conclude that, under these facts, the swaps in the Legacy Portfolio <em>retain their legacy status</em> for both the uncleared swap margin rules (17 CFR 23.150–23.161) and the swap clearing requirement (CEA § 2(h)(1), 17 CFR 50.2 &amp; 50.4). In other words, the internal merger does <em>not</em> drag these positions into mandatory margining or clearing.</li>
    <li><strong>A roadmap for moving grandfathered risk inside dealer groups:</strong> The letter effectively draws a line: using novations or amendments to trade out of margin/clearing is still off-limits, but a bona fide corporate-law merger with no economic changes can move large grandfathered swap books between legal entities inside a dealer group without breaking their exemptions. That makes legacy exposures more <em>organizationally portable</em> than a formalist reading of “assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, or conveyance” might suggest.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Post-crisis rules drew a hard line between “new” swaps that must be margined and, for some products, cleared, and “legacy” swaps that were grandfathered to avoid destabilizing retrofits. CFTC Staff Letter 26-03 clarifies that this line can survive certain internal legal-entity mergers at major dealers, so long as they are structured as mergers by operation of law with no economic or contractual changes and no evasion intent. That is a governance decision about the <em>durability and portability</em> of grandfathered derivatives books inside large financial institutions, and about how far regulators are willing to go to accommodate corporate restructuring without reopening old risk.</p>
