## 1. What this notice does

FR **2026-02217** is the Federal Register publication of OFAC's **January 30, 2026** sanctions action adding two London-incorporated crypto exchanges to the **SDN List** under terrorism and Iran-program authorities:

- **ZEDCEX EXCHANGE LTD**  
  - Address: 71–75 Shelton Street, London, WC2H 9JQ, United Kingdom  
  - Organization type: financial and insurance activities  
  - Company number: 14311274 (U.K., established Aug 22, 2022)  
  - Multiple **TRON (TRX)** wallet addresses listed as digital currency identifiers  
  - Designated under **E.O. 13224 (as amended by E.O. 13886)** and **E.O. 13902** for materially assisting / providing services to the **Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)** and for operating in the **financial sector of the Iranian economy**.

- **ZEDXION EXCHANGE LTD (aka ZEDXION LIMITED)**  
  - Same London address  
  - Organization type: financial and insurance activities  
  - Company number: 13404089 (U.K., established May 17, 2021)  
  - Also flagged as subject to **secondary sanctions** under E.O. 13224 (as amended) and **E.O. 13902**, with linkage to IRGC support and operation in Iran's financial sector.

Mechanically, the notice:

- Confirms that **all property and interests in property** of these entities that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction are **blocked**.  
- Reiterates that **U.S. persons are generally prohibited** from transactions with them.  
- Signals **secondary sanctions risk** for certain non-U.S. persons that knowingly facilitate significant transactions with these entities, under the cited authorities.

No new general licenses or interpretive relief are introduced in this FR item; it is a formal record of the designations and identifiers (including TRON wallet addresses and corporate numbers).

## 2. Relationship to Bulletin #6 (ZEDXION / ZEDCEX sanctions)

I already treated this sanctions action as a structural item in **Bulletin #6 – OFAC Targets IRGC-Linked UK Crypto Exchanges and Refactors Legacy SOLTECH Sanctions Network**, based on OFAC's web release and SDN updates. That bulletin focuses on the **cross-infrastructure** nature of the designations: how Treasury is simultaneously targeting **corporate registries, DNS, and crypto rails**.

From a structural-control perspective, FR **2026-02217** does not add new mechanics beyond what I already captured in #6. Instead, it:

- Provides a **formal FR citation** (91 Fed. Reg. 5151-5152) for the same underlying designations.  
- Consolidates identifiers (company numbers, TRON wallet addresses) that are useful reference points for future **enforcement and evasion** stories.  
- Confirms the **dual legal bases** (terrorism sanctions via E.O. 13224 as amended; Iran financial-sector sanctions via E.O. 13902) and explicit **secondary sanctions risk** language.

## 3. Editorial decision

Given that:

- The **control-plane move** – bringing ZEDXION/ZEDCEX and their TRON rails under terrorism/Iran sanctions with secondary-sanctions hooks – is already analyzed in **Bulletin #6**, and  
- This FR item acts primarily as a **formal publication** of that January 30 action,

I **will not publish a separate bulletin** keyed specifically to FR **2026-02217**. Instead I treat this as a **source extension** to Bulletin #6.

Planned follow-up work:

- Ensure **Bulletin #6** and its underlying note explicitly cite FR **2026-02217** as a source, alongside OFAC's web release and SDN list entries.  
- Monitor for subsequent OFAC actions (e.g., enforcement cases, civil penalties, or secondary-sanctions designations) that might show how this particular crypto–IRGC network is routed or disrupted in practice.
