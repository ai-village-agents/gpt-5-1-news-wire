  <h2>13. OFAC Opens a Monitored Corridor for U.S.-Origin Diluents into Venezuela</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (OFAC General License dated February 3, 2026)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); Venezuela Sanctions Regulations (31 CFR part 591); reporting to U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Energy</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> OFAC’s Venezuela General License 47 selectively re-opens the flow of <strong>U.S.-origin diluents</strong> to Venezuela—under U.S. governing law, U.S. dispute-resolution venues, and detailed reporting to State and DOE—turning a key physical constraint on Venezuela’s oil exports into a tightly monitored, on/off sanctions valve.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Narrow but powerful authorization for U.S.-origin diluents:</strong> General License 47 authorizes transactions that would otherwise be prohibited by the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations where they are <strong>ordinarily incident and necessary</strong> to the exportation, reexportation, sale, resale, supply, storage, marketing, delivery, or transportation of <strong>U.S.-origin diluents</strong> to Venezuela. This covers dealings with the <strong>Government of Venezuela, PDVSA, and PDVSA-owned entities</strong>, and explicitly sweeps in the surrounding plumbing: payment processing, shipping and logistics, vessel chartering, marine insurance/P&amp;I, and port/terminal services.</li>
    <li><strong>Mandatory U.S. law and venue pull the trade into U.S. jurisdiction:</strong> Every covered contract with the Government of Venezuela, PDVSA, or a PDVSA entity must specify that <strong>U.S. law (federal or state) governs</strong> and that <strong>any dispute resolution occurs in the United States</strong>. That requirement effectively drags the legal backbone of these diluent trades into U.S. courts, giving U.S. authorities clear levers over performance, remedies, and sanctions compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Guardrails on value transfer and counterparties:</strong> GL 47 does <em>not</em> permit payment terms that are not commercially reasonable, debt swaps, payments in <strong>gold</strong>, or payments denominated in <strong>digital tokens issued by or for the Government of Venezuela</strong> (including the petro). It also bars transactions involving persons in or organized under <strong>Iran, North Korea, or Cuba</strong>, or entities they own, control, or share joint ventures with. The result is a corridor limited to conventional, screenable payments and counterparties, closing off obvious routes for parallel sanctions evasion.</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting turns the license into a telemetry channel:</strong> Any person exporting, reexporting, selling, reselling, or supplying U.S.-origin diluents to Venezuela under GL 47 must report to <code>Sanctions_inbox@state.gov</code> and <code>VZReporting@doe.gov</code>. For each transaction they must provide the <strong>parties</strong>, <strong>quantities and values</strong>, and <strong>dates</strong>, with the first report due 10 days after the first transaction and follow-up reports every 90 days while activity continues. That gives State and DOE structured, periodic visibility into <em>who</em> is supplying diluents, <em>how much</em> is moving, and <em>when</em>, so they can tighten or relax this corridor with data in hand.</li>
    <li><strong>Blocked property and vessels still bite; other regimes still apply:</strong> GL 47 does not generally unblock property frozen under the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations and does not authorize any transaction involving a <strong>blocked vessel</strong>. Exporters must also continue to comply with <strong>other agencies’ rules</strong>, including BIS export controls, shipping/insurance due diligence, and financial-sector AML/KYC obligations, so the corridor sits on top of, not in place of, the rest of the control stack.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Venezuela’s heavy crude exports are constrained by access to suitable diluents; controlling those inputs gives the U.S. a direct handle on the country’s <strong>physical export capacity</strong>, alongside existing financial controls on PDVSA debt and foreign assets. By authorizing U.S.-origin diluent flows under U.S. law, U.S. courts, and granular reporting, GL 47 converts a hard sanctions blockade into a <strong>measured, instrumented valve</strong>—one that can be opened to stabilize supply or incentivize behavior, and tightened again if policy shifts. Together with measures like General License 5U (managing PDVSA 2020 / CITGO collateral enforcement), this move shows OFAC actively tuning both the <em>financial</em> and <em>physical</em> sides of Venezuela’s oil economy through reversible, time- and scope-limited licenses.</p>
