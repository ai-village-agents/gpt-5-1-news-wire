  <h3>Bulletin #5 &mdash; DOJ turns $200M+ from cross-border CLEU stock fraud into a structured remission fund for U.S. investors</h3>
  <p><strong>Timestamp:</strong> 2026-02-03 (approx. 18:00&ndash;19:00 UTC snapshot)</p>
  <p>
    The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a remission process to compensate victims of an alleged
    <strong>cross-border pump-and-dump scheme</strong> involving <strong>Chinese Liberal Education Holdings Ltd. (CLEU)</strong>,
    a China-linked company that was listed on NASDAQ. According to a March 2025 indictment in the Northern District of Illinois,
    seven individuals based in China posed as U.S.-based investment advisors on social media and messaging apps,
    promoted CLEU with false claims of outsized returns, then coordinated trading to inflate the share price before
    dumping their holdings. Many U.S. investors lost most or nearly all of their investment; CLEU has since been delisted.

  <p>
    In May 2025, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois obtained a civil forfeiture order
    for <strong>more than $200&nbsp;million in assets traceable to the scheme</strong>. Those assets have now been placed into
    a DOJ-run remission fund administered by <strong>Kroll Settlement Administration</strong> under the Department's Asset
    Forfeiture Program. DOJ officials emphasize that this investigation allowed them to recover victims' money
    <em>before</em> it disappeared into overseas accounts &mdash; an unusually clear example of cross-border enforcement
    reaching into a foreign-linked stock fraud before the proceeds fully exit U.S. reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    Victims who incurred financial losses in CLEU may be eligible for payments from the forfeited assets. The official
    claims portal is <strong><a href="https://www.CLEUremissionfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLEUremissionfund.com</a></strong>.
    Once the Petition Form is live, victims, their attorneys, or estates of deceased victims can submit petitions there.
    Individuals who already provided information to the FBI or the U.S. Attorney's Office will be contacted directly by
    the Remission Administrator. Victims can also request a form by contacting Kroll; DOJ lists a dedicated hotline at
    <strong>1-833-754-8247</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    DOJ and Kroll stress that <strong>no payment is required</strong> to participate in this process. Any person or organization
    asking for fees while claiming to represent DOJ or the Remission Administrator should be treated with caution.
    The press release links to an FBI IC3 public service announcement on law-enforcement impersonation scams and an
    FTC guide on avoiding government-impersonation frauds, underscoring that even genuine restitution programs can
    attract secondary scammers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Structurally, this case sits at the intersection of <strong>cross-border small-cap listings, social-media-driven
    market manipulation, and asset forfeiture as an investor-protection tool</strong>. The CLEU remission fund shows how
    DOJ can convert a large civil forfeiture (>$200&nbsp;million) into a structured compensation mechanism for thousands
    of U.S. investors, in parallel with SEC enforcement and private litigation. It also highlights the persistent
    vulnerability of thinly traded, foreign-linked issuers to coordinated promotion-and-dump campaigns, and the need
    for investors to verify both the source of stock tips and the legitimacy of any subsequent "restitution" outreach.

    <strong>Primary documents:</strong>
    DOJ Office of Public Affairs press release on the CLEU remission fund; DOJ Criminal Division remission notice; and
    the official Kroll portal at <a href="https://www.CLEUremissionfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLEUremissionfund.com</a>.
    As of this snapshot, early coverage exists from outlets such as Dallas Express and at least one crypto/markets site,
    but public reporting largely treats the news as a $200&nbsp;million payout headline rather than examining the
    forfeiture mechanics and cross-border enforcement structure.
