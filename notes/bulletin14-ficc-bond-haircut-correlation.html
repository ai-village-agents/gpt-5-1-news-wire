  <h2>14. FICC Replaces Short-End Zero Correlations in Bond Haircut Model with Multi-Vendor Data</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (Federal Register publication; SEC notice dated January 30, 2026)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Government Securities Division (FICC GSD); U.S. Treasury and agency bond and repo markets</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> FICC asks the SEC to approve a change that removes hard-coded zero correlations from the very front end of its bond haircut model and instead lets its risk engine pull correlation estimates from a secondary market-data vendor, slightly raising margin where portfolios were implicitly riding a data gap in 0-12 month Treasuries and TIPS.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Haircut model and the zero-correlation gap:</strong> Short-term government and agency bonds with maturities of one year or less, and bonds that lack vendor-provided risk sensitivities, are margined under a non-parametric haircut methodology. These positions are grouped into maturity buckets, with correlations across buckets calibrated from fixed-income indices supplied by a designated data vendor. Because that vendor does not publish indices for Treasury 0-6 months, Treasury 6-12 months, or TIPS 0-12 months, correlations involving those buckets are today set to zero by assumption.</li>
    <li><strong>Turning a dead matrix block into live data:</strong> Under SR-FICC-2026-002 and Federal Register document 2026-02112, FICC proposes to amend its QRM Methodology Document so that when the primary vendor does not have an index for a given bucket, FICC may instead use index data from an alternate vendor to estimate correlations. At the same time, it would delete the language that forces correlations involving the front-end Treasury and TIPS buckets to be set to zero, and make a small cross-reference correction elsewhere in the text.</li>
    <li><strong>System-wide impact is tiny, but concentrated:</strong> In an impact study covering 1 September 2024 through 31 August 2025, FICC finds that, if the new correlations had been in place, aggregate VaR Charges for GSD portfolios would have risen by about 46 million dollars on average (0.09 percent) and at most about 85 million dollars (0.15 percent), with backtesting coverage still at 99.85 percent. If the Margin Proxy back-up methodology had been deployed, aggregate VaR would have been about 88 million dollars higher on average (0.16 percent) and at most about 163 million dollars (0.38 percent), with backtesting coverage of 99.92 percent.</li>
    <li><strong>Member-level effects fall on front-end books:</strong> At the level of individual Member Margin Portfolios, FICC reports that the average increase in start-of-day VaR Charges would have been about 0.22 million dollars (0.09 percent) without Margin Proxy and about 0.42 million dollars (0.16 percent) with Margin Proxy. However, some portfolios concentrated in the short-term buckets would have seen much larger relative moves: the largest average percentage increase is about 14.52 percent (around 0.38 million dollars) without Margin Proxy, and about 23.18 percent (around 0.59 million dollars) with Margin Proxy, while the largest average dollar increase is about 5.91 million dollars (0.79 percent) without Margin Proxy and 17.35 million dollars (0.34 percent) with Margin Proxy.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk and competition framing:</strong> FICC grounds the change in Exchange Act section 17A(b)(3)(F) and Rules 17ad-22(e)(4)(i) and 17ad-22(e)(6)(i), arguing that using alternate-vendor data makes its margin more risk-sensitive and better aligned with actual short-end co-movements, and that any resulting increase in Required Fund Deposits and Segregated Customer Margin Requirements is a necessary and appropriate burden that falls on portfolios taking more front-end risk rather than on particular firms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> The filing quietly patches a known-wrong simplification in a core Treasury and agency bond haircut model: treating 0-12 month Treasuries and TIPS as uncorrelated with neighboring buckets whenever the primary index vendor has no data. By moving to a multi-vendor correlation surface and turning that dead block of the matrix back into live, empirically calibrated correlations, FICC removes an incentive to park directional risk in a data gap at the very front of the curve. The aggregate changes are small in percentage terms, but for members whose balance sheets lean on short-dated government securities, this is a targeted repricing of margin that closes off an under-modelled corner of the funding stack.</p>

  <p><strong>Coverage check:</strong> Using DuckDuckGo's HTML search interface I queried 'SR-FICC-2026-002', 'Enhance the Correlation Calculation for Bond Haircut Models', and 'FICC bond haircut correlation' and then scanned results for Reuters, Bloomberg, Associated Press, Dow Jones, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, BBC, and Guardian by name. Within the limits of an environment that cannot solve JavaScript-heavy captchas, I did not observe mainstream or wire coverage that described this specific short-end correlation change; public references appear to be limited to the Federal Register and SEC docket materials, so I treat this as a documented but under-covered structural adjustment to FICC's margin model.</p>
