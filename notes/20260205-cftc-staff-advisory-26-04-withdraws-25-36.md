## What the advisory does

CFTC Letter 26-04 is a brief, formal advisory issued jointly by MPD, DMO, and DCR and addressed to:

- Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs)  
- Introducing Brokers (IBs)  
- Designated Contract Markets (DCMs)  
- Derivatives Clearing Organizations (DCOs)

The Divisions **withdraw CFTC Staff Advisory 25-36**, issued 2025-09-30, which had provided staff views on the treatment of certain sports-related event contracts (the "SREC Advisory").

The letter states that:

- Since 25-36 was issued, **the market for event contracts has developed**, and  
- FCMs, IBs, DCMs, and DCOs have gained **experience applying existing Commission regulations** to trading and clearing of those contracts.  

Because of that evolution, the Divisions conclude that **the SREC Advisory is now “moot”** and therefore withdraw it.

The standard CFTC staff disclaimer language emphasizes that:

- The letter does **not create enforceable rights** or binding obligations beyond existing law and regulations.  
- It is **not a no‑action letter** and does not limit potential enforcement recommendations.  
- It does **not create or amend rules** and reflects only the views of the Divisions, not necessarily the Commission.

## Structural reading

This advisory sits alongside (and is announced in) the same 9179-26 press release that also reports **withdrawal of the event-contracts rule proposal** that had been noticed in June 2024. Together they mark a coordinated shift in the Commission’s posture toward sports and other event contracts:

- **From prescriptive staff guidance to case‑by‑case application of core regulations.**  
  - By declaring the SREC Advisory “moot,” MPD/DMO/DCR are explicitly signaling that **existing CEA and CFTC regulations are sufficient** to supervise event contracts without a standing, specialized advisory layer.  
  - This effectively **removes a dedicated interpretive overlay** that some venues and intermediaries may have been using as a de‑facto rulebook for product design and listing decisions.

- **Rewiring compliance obligations for intermediaries.**  
  - FCMs, IBs, DCMs, and DCOs now have to **lean directly on the text of the CEA and Commission rules** (e.g., core principles, suitability, manipulation and fraud standards) rather than on the SREC Advisory as a consolidated reference.  
  - For risk and legal teams, the withdrawal increases the importance of **internal interpretations and direct engagement with staff** when structuring or clearing novel event contracts.

- **Interaction with the withdrawn event‑contracts rule proposal.**  
  - The concurrent withdrawal of both the rule proposal and the SREC Advisory suggests the Commission is **backing away from a bespoke, centralized event‑contracts framework**, at least for now.  
  - Market structure around event contracts will instead be shaped by:  
    - DCM listing decisions and rulebooks,  
    - individual product certifications or approvals, and  
    -, potentially, **future enforcement actions or targeted guidance** rather than a standing advisory.

## Hooks for future monitoring

- Watch for **new or amended DCM rules** on event contracts that may step into the vacuum left by the SREC Advisory.  
- Track whether CFTC staff publishes **no‑action letters, interpretations, or enforcement actions** that effectively rebuild parts of the SREC framework in a more ad‑hoc way.  
- Look for any **Federal Register publications** that formalize the withdrawal of the event‑contracts rule proposal or introduce alternative rulemakings affecting event contracts.
