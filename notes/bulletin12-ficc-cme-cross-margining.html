  <h2>12. FICC and CME Seek to Move Customer U.S. Treasury Cross-Margining Into Futures Law</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (Federal Register publication; SEC notice dated January 30, 2026)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) government securities division; Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) derivatives clearing organization</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> FICC and CME ask the SEC for Section 36 exemptive relief so that certain customers can cross-margin U.S. Treasury securities and related futures in a single futures account, shifting those customers from the stockbroker/SIPA regime into the futures/commodity-broker regime for a defined slice of their Treasury activity.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>From house-only to customer cross-margining:</strong> FICC and CME already run a proprietary cross-margining arrangement that lets a joint broker-dealer / futures commission merchant (BD–FCM) have its own Treasury cash and futures books margined as one portfolio. The new Application asks to extend that framework to <strong>Eligible Customers</strong> of an <strong>Eligible BD–FCM</strong> so their cleared Treasury securities at FICC and Treasury/interest-rate futures at CME can be cross-margined together.</li>
    <li><strong>Key exemption: moving designated customer Treasuries into a futures account:</strong> To enable customer cross-margining, FICC and CME ask the SEC to exempt Eligible BD–FCMs from <strong>Exchange Act Section 15(c)(3)</strong> and the <strong>Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3)</strong> for a narrow set of positions. Specifically, certain customer U.S. Treasury securities and related margin that support the cross-margined portfolio would be held in a <strong>CEA Section 4d futures account</strong> and treated under CFTC segregation rules and <strong>Part 190 commodity-broker liquidation</strong>, rather than in a securities account governed by Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-in and disclosure, not stealth re-labelling:</strong> Cross-margining under the “Proposed Customer XM Framework” is voluntary: it only applies if both the Eligible Customer and its Eligible BD–FCM choose to participate, and only for positions that are already <strong>Eligible Positions</strong> under the existing proprietary arrangement. Before taking any property, the BD–FCM must give the customer a <strong>disclosure document</strong> explaining that (a) the assets will be held in a futures account with subchapter IV protections, and (b) the broker-dealer segregation rules, SIPA customer status, and stockbroker liquidation provisions will not apply to that property.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-conforming subordination agreement rewires bankruptcy treatment:</strong> Each participating customer (an “XM Customer”) must sign a <strong>non-conforming subordination agreement</strong> acknowledging that its cross-margined Treasury securities and associated FICC-held margin will <strong>not</strong> be treated as “customer” property under the Exchange Act or SIPA, and that any SIPA/stockbroker claims tied to those assets will be subordinated to the claims of all other customers. In return, the XM Customer relies on the futures customer protections of CEA Section 4d(a)(2) and Part 190.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk model and governance stay at the CCP layer:</strong> FICC and CME commit to continue calculating initial margin for XM Customer Positions on a <strong>gross, customer-by-customer basis</strong> using the same risk-offsetting methodology as in the house program. They also agree to amend their rulebooks and service guides as needed, and to require each Eligible BD–FCM to collect at least the aggregate initial margin demanded by each clearinghouse and stay in compliance with capital, liquidity, and segregation rules.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Treasury clearing reforms have pushed more activity into central clearing but left open how customers can efficiently manage risk across cash Treasuries and futures. This Application sketches a path to <strong>customer-level cross-margining</strong> that could lower margin costs and encourage more cleared Treasury use, but it does so by deliberately moving a subset of sophisticated customers out of the broker-dealer/SIPA protection stack and into the futures/commodity-broker stack. If the SEC and CFTC both grant the requested exemptions—potentially on terms broad enough for other clearing agency/DCO pairs—this would mark a structural shift in how U.S. Treasury market risk, customer protections, and default management are shared between securities CCPs and futures CCPs.</p>
