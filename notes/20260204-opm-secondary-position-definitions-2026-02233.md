## High-level summary

OPM proposes to revise the regulatory definition of **“secondary positions”** for several enhanced-retirement cohorts:

- law enforcement officers (LEOs)
- firefighters
- nuclear materials couriers
- customs and border protection officers (CBPOs)

The core change: for certain **executive-level secondary positions**, OPM would **remove the current regulatory requirement** that experience in a “primary” (rigorous) position be a *mandatory prerequisite* for occupying the job.

Key points:

- Agencies could designate executive roles in the **direct chain of command** over frontline units as “secondary positions” even if the PD does not require prior primary service.  
- **Enhanced retirement coverage still requires primary service and a qualifying transfer**. Non‑primary hires into those executive positions would *not* gain 6(c)-style enhanced benefits absent statutory change.  
- The change is explicitly motivated by **DHS/CBP recruitment concerns**—they want a wider pool for senior leadership roles without blowing up the 6(c) framework.  
- OPM mirrors the same flexibility across law enforcement, firefighting, nuclear materials transport, and CBPO cohorts to keep the structure consistent.

There are also smaller cleanups:

- Clarified, less‑redundant definitions of **“agency head”** in 5 CFR 831.902 and 842.802.  
- Authority‑citation housekeeping and minor definitional re‑publishing (e.g., “primary duties,” “rigorous position”).  
- Allowing agencies to submit coverage determinations and documentation **electronically** to OPM (several sections in 831.811, 831.911, 831.1611, 842.808, 842.910, 842.1008).

## What the current structure looks like

Under CSRS and FERS, enhanced retirement for covered cohorts is built around a **primary / secondary** position architecture:

- **Primary (rigorous) positions**: frontline roles whose duties are physically demanding and narrowly defined—e.g., investigating, apprehending, detaining criminal suspects; direct firefighting; nuclear materials transport; frontline CBPO duties at ports of entry.  
- **Secondary positions**: 
  - clearly in the same field,  
  - in an organization whose mission is law enforcement, firefighting, nuclear materials transport, or CBP, and  
  - either **supervisory** (first-line supervisors) or **administrative** (managerial/technical/professional) **for which primary experience is a mandatory prerequisite**.

To retain enhanced retirement in a secondary role, an employee generally must:

1. Have at least **3 years in a primary position**;  
2. Transfer **directly** (no >3‑day break) from a primary to a secondary position; and  
3. Remain continuously employed.

OPM’s existing regulations use this structure to:

- Reserve enhanced benefits for workers whose **career trajectory stays inside the rigorous field**; and  
- Keep the program small and cost‑contained, given the higher annuity multipliers and higher employing‑agency contributions.

## What this proposal changes

The text edits are scattered across multiple sections but conceptually do three things:

1. **Create an “executive” subclass of secondary positions** for LEOs, firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, and CBPOs.
2. **Decouple “executive” secondary positions from a mandatory primary‑experience prerequisite**, at the agency’s option. 
3. Preserve the existing **transfer and coverage rules** for employees who *do* have primary experience.

### The new executive secondary definition

For law enforcement and firefighting (e.g. 5 CFR 831.902, 842.802):

> Secondary position means a position that … is either (i) Supervisory … or (ii) Administrative—(A) a managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a primary [rigorous] position is a mandatory prerequisite; or (B) **an executive**, whose principal duty is management of a Federal agency or any subdivision thereof … and whose position is **within the direct chain of command** of a lower‑level operational unit that has a primary mission related to law enforcement or firefighting, **and where the majority of employees in that unit are primary or secondary LEOs/firefighters.**

Parallel language appears for:

- **Nuclear materials couriers** (831.802, 842.902).  
- **CBPOs** in DHS (831.1602, 842.1002), with the mission clause tailored to “arrival and departure of persons, conveyances and merchandise at ports of entry.”

The upshot: **executive positions “in the chain” over frontline units can be treated as secondary positions** even if the PD no longer demands prior primary service for all incumbents.

### Coverage rules remain tied to primary service

OPM is careful to distinguish **position designation** from **individual benefit coverage**:

- An executive position may be designated as secondary even if its PD does not require primary experience.  
- **An incumbent without qualifying primary service cannot gain enhanced retirement coverage** in that job; the statute still links coverage to primary service and direct transfer.  
- Incumbents who *do* have primary (or prior secondary) service and move into a designated secondary executive role **retain enhanced coverage**, so long as transfer and continuity rules are met.

OPM gives a key **non‑retroactivity** example: if someone moved into an executive role in 2023 when it was *not* designated as secondary, they do **not** gain enhanced coverage retroactively if the agency later redesignates the post as a secondary position under the new flexibility.

### Electronic coverage notifications

In multiple sections, OPM updates the mechanism for agencies to notify OPM of coverage determinations:

- Nuclear materials couriers: 5 CFR 831.811(a), 842.910(a).  
- LEOs/firefighters: 831.911(a), 842.808(a).  
- CBPOs: 831.1611(a), 842.1008(a).

These now explicitly allow **electronic submission** (with email addresses given in the rule text), reinforcing that the **coverage‑designation workflow is a managed, centralized process**.

## Structural interpretation: how this rewires the retirement/control plane

### 1. Decoupling leadership eligibility from frontline experience

The existing rules hard‑code a **career‑ladder logic**:

- To run a law‑enforcement, firefighting, CBPO, or nuclear‑transport organization *as an executive*, you must have come up through a **rigorous frontline track**.

OPM’s proposal explicitly responds to DHS/CBP’s complaint that this:

- Constrains the **candidate pool** for senior roles to a single occupational series; and  
- Makes it difficult to bring in leaders with **different technical skill‑sets** (e.g., complex logistics, data, or management expertise).

By carving out an “executive” secondary category that **does not require primary experience in the PD**, OPM is:

- Opening the top of these hierarchies to **generalist SES talent** and other senior managers; while  
- Still allowing agencies to **retain the old prerequisite** where they want to preserve a “came‑up‑through‑the-ranks” requirement.

This is a subtle but real **governance‑of‑the‑armed‑wings change**: it shifts who is eligible to command organizations with police powers, firefighting authorities, or control over nuclear materials and borders.

### 2. Preserving 6(c)-style incentives for those who stay in the field

Enhanced retirement is one of the main tools the federal system uses to:

- Encourage **early entry and continuous service** in physically demanding or high‑risk roles; and  
- Make promotion into supervision/management **compatible with that incentive**, so people aren’t punished for taking on leadership.

OPM deliberately keeps the **coverage rules unchanged** for:

- Employees who start in primary positions,  
- Accrue the required primary service, and  
- Move through secondary—now including the new executive‑level secondary posts.

So the proposal **loosens who can hold the job** but **doesn’t expand who gets the benefit** without Congress acting. That preserves a strong incentive for people who enter early and stay on the rigorous track, while making room for occasional **“outside” executives** who come in without 6(c) coverage.

From a control‑plane view, this is similar to **adding a new role type** in an access‑control matrix:

- Before: `Executive secondary` implicitly required `primary_experience == true` at the position level.  
- After: `Executive secondary` is a role; **coverage is enforced at the *user* attribute level** (primary service history + transfer path), not at the role definition level.

### 3. Position‑designation as a regulated, appealable gateway

The rule reiterates that:

- Agencies **must formally designate** positions as primary/secondary and submit determinations (now electronically).  
- OPM retains authority to **overrule** those determinations.  
- Coverage decisions remain **appealable to the MSPB**.

This is significant because once “executive” secondary positions can exist without a primary‑service prerequisite, the **designation step becomes the choke point** that decides:

- Which billets are part of the enhanced‑retirement pipeline; and  
- Which senior jobs are kept inside a closed career ladder vs opened to broader competition.

The move to standardized email submissions formalizes this as a kind of **central registry of privileged positions** in federal law‑enforcement‑adjacent work.

### 4. Impact scope: a few thousand executives, but core institutions

OPM estimates roughly **3,206 Executive Branch employees** at GS‑15 or above currently have enhanced retirement coverage. These are effectively the **top tiers of the 6(c) universe**:

- Senior law‑enforcement and firefighting managers,  
- High‑level CBPO leadership,  
- Nuclear materials courier management.

Those are the roles where this rule changes **competition and eligibility**. Structurally, the rule lets agencies:

- Treat enhanced‑retirement eligibility as a **personal attribute** earned through a career path,  
- While allowing some of the leadership chairs to be occupied by **non‑frontline specialists** without altering the benefit schema.

In terms of how the federal state governs its coercive and safety functions, this is a significant **rebalancing of “insider” vs “generalist executive” control**.

## Coverage / under‑coverage notes

This is a relatively technical OPM proposal in the retirement parts of 5 CFR, not a high‑visibility national‑security or budget item.

- The FR notice is clearly visible in the Federal Register and likely in niche HR/retirement newsletters.  
- There are no obvious signs (as of drafting) of **mainstream coverage** tying this to the broader questions of:  
  - who leads federal law‑enforcement and firefighting bodies,  
  - how 6(c) incentives shape those pipelines, or  
  - whether opening executive positions to non‑frontline backgrounds changes organizational culture.

Given the technical venue (OPM retirement regs) and the lack of headline‑friendly framing, this appears **structurally significant but likely under‑covered** outside specialized federal HR and practitioner circles.
