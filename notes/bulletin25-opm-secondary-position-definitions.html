  <h2>25. OPM quietly opens senior law-enforcement and firefighter jobs to non-frontline executives while preserving 6(c) retirement incentives.</h2>
  <p>
    On February 4, 2026, the Office of Personnel Management proposed a rule to change how
    <strong>“secondary positions”</strong> are defined for several enhanced-retirement cohorts under the Civil
    Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS).
    The rule would let agencies treat certain <strong>executive-level roles in the direct chain of command</strong>
    over frontline units as secondary positions even when the position description no longer requires
    prior “primary” (rigorous) service—while still tying <em>individual</em> enhanced-retirement eligibility to
    primary service and a qualifying transfer path.
  </p>

  <h3>What the proposal does</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Scope.</strong> The rule covers law enforcement officers, firefighters, nuclear materials couriers,
      and customs and border protection officers (CBPOs) across 5 CFR parts <strong>831</strong> and <strong>842</strong>, with
      conforming language in multiple sections (e.g., <code>831.802</code>, <code>831.902</code>, <code>831.1602</code>,
      <code>842.802</code>, <code>842.902</code>, <code>842.1002</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>New “executive” secondary category.</strong> OPM defines an <em>executive</em> secondary position as one whose
      principal duty is management of a federal agency or subdivision, <strong>within the direct chain of
      command of a lower-level operational unit</strong> whose primary mission is law enforcement,
      firefighting, nuclear materials transport, or CBP functions, and where the majority of employees
      in that unit are in primary or secondary positions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Decoupling job eligibility from primary experience.</strong> Agencies may designate such executive jobs as
      secondary positions <strong>without</strong> keeping “experience in a primary position” as a mandatory
      prerequisite in the PD. Executive roles can therefore be opened to broader senior‑leadership
      talent pools (e.g., SES generalists, managers with different technical backgrounds).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Coverage logic stays strict.</strong> Individuals still need qualifying primary service and a compliant
      transfer (no >3‑day break, continuous employment) to receive enhanced retirement coverage.
      A non‑frontline executive hired into a secondary position <strong>does not</strong> gain 6(c)‑style benefits;
      coverage remains a function of the individual’s service history, not just the position label.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Centralized designation workflow.</strong> Agencies must continue to notify OPM of primary/secondary
      coverage determinations, which the rule explicitly shifts to <strong>electronic submission</strong>
      (email-based workflows) for law enforcement, firefighters, nuclear materials couriers, and CBPOs.
      OPM retains authority to overturn designations, and coverage decisions remain <strong>appealable to MSPB</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Motivation.</strong> The preamble cites a Department of Homeland Security / CBP request: current rules
      constrain executive hiring to people with rigorous primary CBPO experience, limiting diversity of
      skills and backgrounds in senior leadership. OPM’s solution is to relax the position‑level
      prerequisite while keeping the statutory benefit constraints intact.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How this rewires the control plane</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Who can command coercive institutions.</strong> Historically, senior managers in federal law enforcement,
      firefighting, CBP, and nuclear‑courier organizations were structurally drawn from frontline tracks:
      the regulations embedded a <em>“came up through the ranks”</em> requirement. By introducing an
      executive secondary category that does not require primary experience, OPM is <strong>decoupling
      leadership eligibility from frontline tenure</strong>—making it easier to seat generalist executives atop
      organizations with police powers and safety mandates.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enhanced retirement as an individual attribute.</strong> The proposal treats 6(c)‑style coverage less as a
      property of a given billet and more as a <strong>personal state variable</strong> earned via career path
      (rigorous service + compliant transfer). Executive jobs become mixed: some incumbents keep
      enhanced benefits, others never qualify. This is effectively a shift from
      <em>position‑based entitlements</em> to <em>person‑based entitlements</em> at the top of the hierarchy.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Designation becomes the main gate.</strong> Because executive positions can now be secondary even without
      a primary‑experience prerequisite, the formally documented designation that agencies send to OPM
      (and that OPM can overrule) becomes the <strong>critical control point</strong> deciding which leadership
      roles sit inside the enhanced‑retirement pipeline and which remain outside it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Culture and pipeline implications.</strong> OPM estimates about <strong>3,206</strong> GS‑15+ employees currently have
      enhanced retirement coverage; these are the top tiers of the 6(c) universe. Allowing executive
      positions to be filled by non‑frontline candidates broadens the talent pool for those chairs but
      also changes the <strong>bargain for frontline staff</strong>: the incentive of enhanced retirement still exists,
      but the path to command is no longer structurally reserved for those who came through primary
      roles.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why this is structurally important and under-covered</h3>
  <p>
    This is a technical OPM retirement proposal in 5 CFR parts 831 and 842, not a headline‑grabbing
    criminal‑justice or homeland‑security story. Yet it directly reconfigures <strong>who can lead federal
    organizations with law‑enforcement, firefighting, nuclear‑transport, and border‑control powers</strong>,
    and how the enhanced‑retirement incentive structure is layered into those leadership pipelines.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of drafting, there are no clear signs of mainstream coverage connecting this rule to broader
    questions about control of armed or safety functions (e.g., framing it as a shift from
    career‑insider leadership to more generalist executives, or as a change in how 6(c) benefits gate
    those tracks). Coverage appears limited to the Federal Register and specialist HR/retirement
    circles.
