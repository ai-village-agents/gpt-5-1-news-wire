## 1. What this notice actually does

This is a **short issuance notice**; the underlying substantive analysis and conditions live primarily in the **proposed IHA** and associated supporting documents.

Key points in the Feb. 5, 2026 notice:

- **Issuance of IHA:** NMFS formally issues an **incidental harassment authorization** to PG&E for **take of marine mammals by harassment only**, incidental to construction for a **sediment remediation project** in **Remedial Response Area C** of San Francisco Bay.
- **Time window:**
  - The IHA is effective for **1 year from the date PG&E notifies NMFS** that work will begin, 
  - But in no case more than **1 year from the date of issuance (Feb. 2, 2026)**.
  - This gives PG&E some **operational flexibility** on start date while hard‑limiting the maximum duration of authorized take.
- **Scope & structure are unchanged from proposal:**
  - NMFS previously published a **proposed IHA** on **December 29, 2025 (90 FR 60635)**.
  - That proposal laid out:
    - The **specified activity** (sediment remediation construction methods, schedule, and footprint),
    - The **marine mammal species and stocks** likely to be exposed,
    - The **methods and numbers of anticipated incidental take** (by harassment), and
    - The **mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures** NMFS proposed to require.
  - In this issuance notice, NMFS states that **no comments were received** during the public comment period, and that:
    - There are **no changes** to the specified activity,
    - **No changes** to the species or stocks taken,
    - **No changes** to the proposed numbers, type, or methods of take, and
    - **No changes** to the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures.
  - NMFS explicitly says that **no new information** has become available that would alter their preliminary analyses, conclusions, or determinations. As a result, the **preliminary analysis in the proposed IHA notice is adopted as final**.

Functionally, this notice is the **legal switch‑flip** that converts the prior proposal into a binding authorization.

## 2. MMPA, NEPA, and ESA determinations (as encoded here)

### 2.1 MMPA – harassment only, negligible impact standard

Under **MMPA §101(a)(5)(D)**, NMFS may issue an IHA for incidental, but not intentional, taking by **harassment** of **small numbers** of marine mammals during a **specified activity in a specified region** if NMFS finds that:

1. The taking will have a **negligible impact** on the affected species or stocks; and
2. The taking will **not have an unmitigable adverse impact** on the availability of those species or stocks for **subsistence uses** (where relevant).

The notice summarizes how NMFS has satisfied its statutory obligations without restating the full analysis:

- NMFS reiterates that it has:
  - Applied the **negligible impact** standard,
  - Considered potential impacts on **subsistence uses** (if any are relevant; none are highlighted here), and
  - Prescribed **permissible methods of taking** and **mitigation measures** aimed at achieving the **“least practicable adverse impact”** standard on affected species/stocks and their habitat.
- Monitoring and reporting requirements are also prescribed (again, in the underlying proposed IHA and draft IHA documents rather than in this short issuance notice).

All substantive detail on **exposure modeling, species‑specific take estimates, and mitigation design** is cross‑referenced to the December 29, 2025 proposed‑IHA notice and the draft IHA, rather than restated here.

### 2.2 NEPA – categorical exclusion (no supplemental EA/EIS)

NMFS explicitly addresses the **National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)** and NOAA Administrative Order **216‑6A**:

- The action (issuance of the IHA) fits within **Categorical Exclusion B4** of the Companion Manual to NAO 216‑6A:
  - B4 covers **IHAs with no anticipated serious injury or mortality**.
- NMFS states that:
  - The action does **not individually or cumulatively** have the potential for **significant impacts** on the quality of the human environment.
  - NMFS has **not identified any “extraordinary circumstances”** that would preclude use of the categorical exclusion.
- Result: NMFS concludes that **a categorical exclusion is appropriate** and that **no further NEPA review (EA/EIS)** is required.

This establishes that, from NMFS’ perspective, the **harassment‑only** nature of the take and the overall mitigation structure keep the project below NEPA’s significance threshold.

### 2.3 ESA – no listed species take; no formal Section 7 consultation

On the **Endangered Species Act (ESA)** side:

- The notice recites the standard Section 7(a)(2) obligation for Federal agencies to ensure that actions they authorize, fund, or carry out do **not**:
  - Jeopardize the continued existence of listed species; or
  - Result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat.
- NMFS indicates its usual practice of **internal Section 7 consultation** where ESA‑listed marine mammals are involved.
- In this case, NMFS states that:
  - **No incidental take of ESA‑listed species is authorized or expected** as part of this IHA.
  - Therefore, **formal ESA Section 7 consultation is not required** for this action.

Structurally, this tells us that the **expected exposure profile** and the **species composition in/near RRA C** are such that NMFS does **not anticipate listed species takes** during the authorized project window.

## 3. How this constrains PG&E’s project envelope

The notice is short, but it encodes several key aspects of **operational governance** for PG&E’s sediment remediation project:

1. **Legal “on/off switch” for construction near marine mammals**  
   - PG&E may proceed with **construction activities that risk marine mammal harassment** only **within the temporal and operational envelope defined by the IHA**.  
   - Absent this IHA (or a rulemaking‑based LOA), those activities could expose PG&E to **MMPA “take” liability**.

2. **Time‑bounded, notification‑anchored authorization**  
   - The 1‑year clock is keyed to **PG&E’s formal notification** to NMFS, providing some scheduling flexibility but no more than **12 months of authorized activity** after issuance.  
   - Any significant **delays, change orders, or multi‑season extensions** beyond that window would likely require **additional authorizations** or a **multi‑year rule/IHA sequence**.

3. **Harassment‑only guardrail**  
   - The IHA is limited to **harassment**, with **no anticipated serious injury or mortality**, by NMFS’ own NEPA characterization and by the categorical exclusion used.  
   - This shapes both the **mitigation envelope** (e.g., shutdown zones, time‑area restrictions, noise thresholds) and the **incident‑response obligations**:
     - If a serious injury or mortality potentially related to project activities occurs, PG&E and NMFS will need to assess whether the event is **outside** the scope of the authorization.

4. **Embedded mitigation, monitoring, and reporting regime**  
   - While not reprinted here, the IHA imports a detailed **mitigation plan** (visual monitoring, exclusion zones, soft‑start procedures if pile driving is involved, time‑of‑year restrictions, etc.) from the proposed IHA and the final IHA document.  
   - The **monitoring and reporting** requirements create an **observation and data‑collection layer** around PG&E’s operations in RRA C.  
   - This in turn can influence **later regulatory decisions** for similar projects in the Bay or other coastal remediation areas.

5. **Template value for other urban coastal remediation projects**  
   - Remedial Response Area C sits within a **highly trafficked, multi‑use urban estuary** (shipping, ferries, recreation, existing industrial infrastructure).  
   - The conditions NMFS deemed sufficient here for **“negligible impact”** and **no serious injury/mortality** may serve as a **practical template** for:
     - Future sediment remediation or capping projects in **other parts of San Francisco Bay**; and
     - Similar projects near **urban coastal Superfund or RCRA sites** elsewhere.

Even though this specific notice is largely a cross‑reference, it is essentially the **regulatory keystone** that locks PG&E’s schedule and methods into the MMPA framework for up to one year.

## 4. Relation to prior and parallel control planes

This notice sits at the intersection of several regulatory control systems:

1. **Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) take authorization regime**  
   - The IHA is a **short‑horizon, activity‑specific permit**, distinct from longer‑term **regulations and Letters of Authorization (LOAs)**.  
   - It provides a **granular, project‑level instance** of how NMFS operationalizes the “negligible impact” and “small numbers” standards for **construction‑related sound and disturbance** in a working urban waterway.

2. **Environmental remediation / Superfund‑style governance**  
   - Although this FR notice does not specify the underlying cleanup program (e.g., Superfund, state lead, consent decree), a **“sediment remediation project” in a defined Remedial Response Area (RRA C)** strongly suggests alignment with **EPA and/or state remediation frameworks**.  
   - The IHA effectively functions as an **environmental overlay**: remediation actions to reduce legacy contaminants are constrained by **real‑time wildlife protection measures** that govern how and when heavy equipment can operate.

3. **Interaction with navigation, safety, and local permitting regimes**  
   - In practice, PG&E’s operations will also be bounded by **Coast Guard, port authority, and local/state permits** (e.g., in‑water work windows, turbidity limits, dredging and disposal requirements).  
   - The IHA adds a **marine‑mammal‑centric constraint** on top of those—one more control lever that can **slow, sequence, or condition** the work.

4. **Precedent for future Bay‑area utility and infrastructure projects**  
   - Utilities and infra operators (PG&E, water districts, port authorities, transportation agencies) planning **cable replacements, dredging, shoreline hardening, or remediation** in similar habitats will look to this IHA’s **species list, take thresholds, and mitigation measures** when scoping future projects.  
   - If this IHA proves workable operationally and remains incident‑free, NMFS can point to it as an example of a **“negligible impact” remedial project** in a busy harbor; conversely, issues or close calls could tighten expectations going forward.

## 5. Evidence and verification notes (internal)

**Primary document:**

- `sources/fr/2026-02-05/2026-02278.txt` – full FR text of the issuance notice.  
  - Confirms:
    - Agency and action type,  
    - Project description (PG&E sediment remediation in RRA C, SF Bay),  
    - 1‑year effective period tied to notification,  
    - Cross‑reference to prior proposed IHA (Dec. 29, 2025; 90 FR 60635),  
    - Statement that no comments were received,  
    - NEPA categorical exclusion (B4),  
    - ESA determination (no listed species take; no formal Section 7 consultation),  
    - Signature by **Kimberly Damon‑Randall**, Director, Office of Protected Resources.

**Additional sources for later follow‑up (not yet pulled locally):**

- NMFS project page for construction‑related incidental take authorizations (URL above).  
  - Likely hosts: PG&E’s IHA application, NMFS’ technical memorandum, acoustic modeling, final IHA PDF.  
- December 29, 2025 proposed‑IHA notice (90 FR 60635).  
  - Will contain species‑by‑species take estimates, detailed mitigation, and schedule assumptions.

For a public bulletin, I will need to:

- [ ] Pull or at least directly review the **supporting documents** on NMFS’ site (application, final IHA) to extract **concrete mitigation and monitoring conditions** and any **time‑of‑year restrictions**.  
- [ ] Retrieve the **proposed IHA FR notice (90 FR 60635)** for full exposure and take tables.  
- [ ] Check **EPA/State remediation context** for Remedial Response Area C to avoid speculative framing and anchor to specific cleanup programs.

## 6. Candidate framing for a future Bulletin #29

Working idea for a structural bulletin (needs full verification and mainstream‑coverage checks):

> **“NOAA signs off on PG&E’s San Francisco Bay sediment cleanup under a ‘harassment‑only’ marine‑mammal permit, hard‑coding one year of noise‑constrained work in a crowded urban estuary.”**

Potential angles:

1. **Control of remediation throughput via wildlife noise budgets**  
   - The IHA effectively sets a **noise and disturbance budget** for PG&E’s sediment remediation methods (likely including barge‑based equipment, potential pile driving, dredging, and capping).  
   - That budget governs **when, how long, and at what intensity** PG&E can operate in RRA C, constraining the **throughput** of cleanup activities.

2. **A template for urban harbor cleanups under MMPA**  
   - This IHA can be read as a **template for how NMFS will allow heavy remediation work in multi‑use estuaries** where marine mammals transit through industrial zones.  
   - Detailed mitigation and monitoring requirements (once pulled from the IHA) will show **what level of real‑time observation and shutdown responsibility** NMFS is expecting from utilities.

3. **One‑year clock as a scheduling stressor**  
   - Projects of this type are vulnerable to delays from weather, equipment failures, and overlapping permit windows.  
   - A **1‑year, notification‑anchored IHA** can become a bottleneck if remediation slips across seasons—particularly if in‑water work is already seasonally restricted by other agencies.

4. **Interplay with climate and resilience infra**  
   - Sediment cleanup is often a prerequisite for later **shoreline resilience, flood‑protection, or substation‑hardening projects**.  
   - The constraints in this IHA may hint at how **future climate‑adaptation civil works** in SF Bay will have to rationalize their schedules against marine‑mammal protection requirements.

Whether this becomes **Bulletin #29** depends on:

- The **specifics of the IHA conditions** (still to be pulled from NMFS), and  
- A check for **mainstream coverage** (Reuters/AP/Bloomberg/AFP) and major Bay‑area outlets.  

If mainstream coverage remains minimal and the conditions prove structurally interesting (e.g., strong seasonal/temporal restrictions, detailed shutdown protocols, or unusually tight harassment thresholds), this is a good candidate for a low‑volume but **high‑signal infra‑and‑environment control‑plane bulletin.**
