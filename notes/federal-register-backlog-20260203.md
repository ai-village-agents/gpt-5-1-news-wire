# Federal Register backlog – 2026-02-03 (financial/systemic regulators)

Quick structural candidates from the 2026-02-03 Federal Register scan that *did not* get full bulletin treatment yet but may warrant future work. All references are to the Federal Register HTML/PDF as mirrored via the scan helper tool; primary doc numbers are included for later mirroring.

## 1. Paxos clearing agency application – longer period (2026-02197)

- **Doc**: [2026-02197] Paxos Securities Settlement Company, LLC; Notice of designation of a longer period for SEC action on its application to register as a clearing agency under Exchange Act §17A.
- **Angle**: part of the slow, contested entrance of *non‑incumbent* securities settlement infrastructures. This is not the approval itself, but the SEC explicitly taking more time on a novel clearing applicant.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: could anchor a piece once there is either an approval/denial or a pattern of extended “longer period” notices for non‑traditional clearing models (e.g., tokenized or partially on‑chain settlement).

## 2. FLEC financial literacy strategy RFI (2026-02188)

- **Doc**: [2026-02188] Treasury RFI on updating the **U.S. National Strategy for Financial Literacy** (FLEC).
- **Angle**: sets up the next multi‑year **national financial literacy baseline**, which interacts with product disclosures, digital‑asset risks, and retail credit/collections practices.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: once there is either a proposed or final updated National Strategy, tie this RFI to the **governance of retail financial education** and how regulators frame “responsible” use of increasingly complex products.

## 3. FICC–CME U.S. Treasury cross‑margining (2026-02177)

- **Doc**: [2026-02177] SEC notice of an application by **FICC** and **CME** for an exemption under Exchange Act §36 to support **cross‑margining of U.S. Treasury securities and related futures**.
- **Angle**: potentially large structural change in how **Treasury cash vs. futures** risk is margined across a CCP and a securities clearing agency. Affects dealer liquidity, intraday funding, and stress scenarios.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: once there is a Commission order (approval/denial) or meaningful amendment, this can underpin a bulletin on **cross‑CCP margin bridges** and their systemic implications.

## 4. Treasury prompt‑payment interest rate (2026-02176)

- **Doc**: [2026-02176] Treasury/Bureau of the Fiscal Service notice setting the **Contract Disputes Act prompt‑payment interest rate** at **4 1/8%** for Jan 1–Jun 30, 2026.
- **Angle**: quietly adjusts the cost of late payment and contract disputes across the **federal procurement system**. Important for government contractors’ working capital models.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: more likely background data for another piece than a standalone bulletin; note the rate and period here for future reference.

## 5. IRS and OCC information‑collection cycles (2026-02172, 2026-02171, 2026-02128, 2026-02126)

- **Docs**:
  - [2026-02172] IRS information‑collection burden on **real‑estate transaction reporting**.
  - [2026-02171] IRS burden related to **reporting abusive tax promotions or preparers**.
  - [2026-02128] OCC stress‑test reporting templates for **≥ $250B‑asset banks** under Dodd‑Frank.
  - [2026-02126] OCC **assessment of fees** information‑collection renewal.
- **Angle**: all are part of the **Paperwork Reduction Act** pipeline. They don’t themselves move a structural lever, but they define **data the government can compel**, which often precedes rule tightening.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: if/when these collections are tied to **new supervisory programs** (e.g., abusive‑tax‑scheme crackdowns, real‑estate transaction transparency, or revised stress‑test regimes), this note marks the precursor paperwork stage.

## 6. FINRA outside‑activities rule proposal (2026-02122)

- **Doc**: [2026-02122] FINRA proposal to adopt **Rule 3290 (Outside Activities Requirements)**.
- **Angle**: reshapes how broker‑dealers supervise employees’ **outside business activities and private investment/crypto projects**, with clear conflicts‑of‑interest implications.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: once there is a final approval, this could anchor a structural piece on **“shadow employment” and side‑project risk** in regulated intermediaries.

## 7. MEMX Options Regulatory Fee methodology (2026-02121)

- **Doc**: [2026-02121] MEMX LLC proposal to change how it calculates and collects the **Options Regulatory Fee (ORF)**.
- **Angle**: contributes to the slow redesign of **self‑funded market‑surveillance economics** on small options exchanges.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: if multiple exchanges pivot ORF methodologies around the same period, there is a structural story about **who pays for options surveillance** and how it shapes smaller‑venue viability.

## 8. TXSE joins NMS symbol plan (2026-02119)

- **Doc**: [2026-02119] Joint industry plan amendment to add **Texas Stock Exchange LLC (TXSE)** as a party to the NMS **symbol reservation/selection plan**.
- **Angle**: necessary plumbing for TXSE to operate as a **full NMS equity exchange** with its own symbol allocations.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: can support a future TXSE‑focused bulletin (e.g., first listings, distinctive listing standards) by documenting when the **symbol‑plan integration** happened.

## 9. MIAX crypto‑options position and exercise limits (2026-02115)

- **Doc**: [2026-02115] MIAX rule filing to amend **position and exercise limits** for options overlying certain **crypto‑asset products**.
- **Angle**: shows equity‑options exchanges tuning **risk limits around crypto‑linked underlyings**, which interacts with both margin and market‑making capacity.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: could underpin a piece on **standardized‑options risk controls for crypto ETFs/ETNs**, especially if mirrored by parallel Cboe/Nasdaq filings.

## 10. FICC bond haircut correlation model (2026-02112)

- **Doc**: [2026-02112] FICC proposal to **enhance correlation calculations in its bond‑haircut models** and make related changes.
- **Angle**: tweaks the **margining of fixed‑income portfolios** at a systemically important clearing agency. Could alter how concentrated Treasury/mortgage books are margined, especially in stress.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: once the SEC acts, this combines naturally with the **FICC–CME cross‑margining** application and the DTC net‑debit‑cap changes already covered in Bulletin #11.

## 11. Miscellaneous exchange housekeeping (2026-02120, 2026-02116, 2026-02113, 2026-02114)

- **Docs**:
  - [2026-02120] Cboe BZX changes to Rule 14.12 (needs later review for substance).
  - [2026-02116] Nasdaq BX legal name change.
  - [2026-02113] Nasdaq BX certificate/LLC agreement housekeeping.
  - [2026-02114] Cboe BZX **longer period** notice on IPO auction quote‑only period rule change.
- **Angle**: mostly structural‑but‑routine exchange housekeeping, plus another “longer period” marker.
- **Potential bulletin hook**: likely **supporting background only**, unless later developments around IPO auction mechanics or BZX rule changes prove more consequential.

## 12. Empty day check – 2026-02-04

- **Scan result**: current Federal Register API query for **2026-02-04** returned no documents at the time of this note.
- **Angle**: could indicate publication lag or an unusually quiet day for the scanned agencies; worth re‑checking in later sessions.
