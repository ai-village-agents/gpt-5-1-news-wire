## 1. What this SORN actually does

Treasury’s Departmental Offices are standing up a new, consolidated **Privacy Act system of records** to cover data used in the administration, compliance, and oversight of a broad slate of **federal financial assistance programs** that Treasury runs outside of IRS.

The **DO .0197 – Financial Assistance Programs** system covers at least the following named programs (plus "other such programs Treasury may administer"):

- **Capital Projects Fund (CPF)** program
- **Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA)** programs
- **Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF)** program
- **Local Assistance and Tribal Consistency Fund (LATCF)** program
- **RESTORE Act programs**, including:
  - Direct Component
  - Centers of Excellence Research Grants Program
- **Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (SIPPRA)** program
- **State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF)** program
- **State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI)** programs
- Any **similar financial assistance programs** that Treasury DO may later administer

The SORN states that Treasury will use this system for:

> "information collected in connection with the administration of financial assistance programs by Treasury Departmental Offices".

Purposes explicitly listed include:

- evaluating **compliance** with program requirements and applicable federal law, regulations, and EOs
- supporting **audit and program oversight** activities
- identifying **waste, fraud, and abuse**
- using data for **research and statistical purposes**

In effect, Treasury is declaring a **unified DO-wide data system** for individual- and entity-level information across these assistance programs, with a broad set of routine uses allowing sharing for program integrity, enforcement, and research.

## 2. Data model – who is in scope and what gets collected

### 2.1 Categories of individuals

The **categories of individuals** section is very broad. The system covers:

1. **Individual beneficiaries** of Treasury financial assistance programs – the ultimate persons or entities that receive the benefit of federal assistance.
2. **Individuals associated with business or non-profit beneficiaries**, such as:
   - owners of small businesses or non-profits that receive assistance,
   - employees of such entities.
3. **Individuals associated with program delivery**, including:
   - employees, agents, or representatives of **recipients** (e.g., states, local governments, Tribes),
   - employees, agents, or representatives of **subrecipients**, and
   - employees, agents, or representatives of **contractors or vendors** who carry out or support program activities.
4. **Any other individuals** whose information Treasury DO receives, directly or indirectly, in the course of:
   - program administration,
   - compliance,
   - audit,
   - oversight,
   - research and statistical activities.

Recipients and subrecipients are defined broadly (states, territories, Tribes, local governments, public authorities, non-profits, for-profits, etc.), so this effectively pulls into scope **everyone whose data flows through Treasury’s oversight of these programs**, whether they are end-beneficiaries or intermediaries.

### 2.2 Categories of records

Records are described as **whatever information program recipients, subrecipients, and their contractors maintain** for eligibility, administration, and oversight of Treasury-funded assistance, including:

- **Application materials** and supporting documentation submitted by applicants for assistance
- **Information about awards and transactions**:
  - amounts of assistance awarded or received
  - periods of assistance, including specific dates
  - documentation about contracts funded by Treasury assistance
- **Personal and financial identifiers**, including:
  - full legal name
  - unique identifiers or application IDs assigned by recipients/subrecipients/contractors
  - residential address and contact information
  - reported income and household financial information
  - self-attestations, certifications, signatures
  - supporting documentation provided by applicants
  - information about employees or owners of entities (recipient, subrecipient, contractor, or business beneficiary)
  - **Social Security numbers or taxpayer identification numbers**
- **Employment-related and financial data** needed for eligibility determinations, payments, audits, or program-integrity functions

The **record source** is primarily recipients, subrecipients, and contractors that manage the programs – i.e., Treasury is formalizing central ingestion of data that was previously scattered across state/local systems and vendor platforms.

## 3. Routine uses – where data can go

The SORN lists a long set of **routine uses** under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3). Several are boilerplate (DOJ litigation, congressional inquiries, NARA, etc.), but a few are structurally important because they codify how Treasury can repurpose and share assistance data.

Key routine uses include:

1. **Program-integrity and eligibility sharing (Routine use 2)** – To federal agencies, non-federal entities (including states and local governments), and their contractors/agents, for:
   - identification, prevention, and recovery of **improper payments**
   - identification and prevention of **fraud, waste, and abuse** in federal programs (Treasury’s or others’)
   - establishing or verifying eligibility and ongoing compliance for assistance or payments under federal programs
   - **recouping payments or recovering delinquent debts**

   This makes DO .0197 a data source for **cross-program improper-payment and fraud analytics**, not just internal Treasury use.

2. **Research, evaluation, and risk management (Routine use 3)** – To contractors, grantees, experts, consultants, other federal agencies, state/local governments, and research institutions for:
   - statistical analysis and research in support of **program operations, management, performance monitoring, evaluation, risk management, and policy development**, or
   - **other research and statistical purposes not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation**.

   This explicitly authorizes use of detailed beneficiary and intermediary data for **research and policy analytics**, including by non-federal partners, subject to legal constraints.

3. **Law enforcement and suitability checks (Routine uses 4–6, 9–10)** – To:
   - law enforcement and regulatory agencies when there is a potential civil or criminal law violation,
   - agencies making decisions about hiring, security clearances, licenses, grants, or other benefits,
   - public/professional licensing organizations when information indicates a violation of professional standards.

4. **Debt collection and credit reporting (Routine uses 13–15)** – To:
   - other federal agencies to effect salary or administrative offsets,
   - **consumer reporting agencies** to obtain credit reports,
   - **debt collection agencies**, including use of IRS-derived addresses in some circumstances.

5. **Breach response (Routine uses 19–20)** – Standard post-OMB guidance language allowing disclosures to other agencies, entities, and persons to respond to or mitigate data breaches involving the system.

Overall, the routine uses turn DO .0197 into a **multi-purpose, shareable dataset**: not just a ledger of assistance, but an input to **improper payment detection, fraud enforcement, eligibility cross-checking, credit/debt operations, and external research.**

## 4. Safeguards, retrieval, and retention

- **Storage:** Records are stored electronically in secure facilities; paper records, if any, in locked physical storage or secure offsite locations.
- **Retrieval:** Records may be retrieved "by name or another unique identifier" – i.e., Treasury can look up assistance histories by person, entity, or system keys.
- **Retention:** To follow National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) schedules, not yet spelled out in detail.
- **Security:**
  - Compliance with Treasury information security policies
  - Access limited to individuals with a "need to know" and appropriate permissions
  - User activity recording/auditing
  - **Encryption at rest and in transit**
  - Buildings with 24-hour security

Access, contesting, and notification procedures are routed through existing Treasury Privacy Act/FOIA processes (31 CFR part 1, subpart C, appendix A).

## 5. Structural significance

### 5.1 Unifying a fragmented pandemic-era assistance universe

The named programs – ERA, HAF, SLFRF, LATCF, SSBCI, CPF, RESTORE, SIPPRA – represent **trillions of dollars of authorized aid** and a sprawling network of state, local, tribal, and non-profit intermediaries. To date, data about who ultimately received what, under which eligibility rules, has often lived in **separate state systems, vendor platforms, and bespoke program databases.**

By creating DO .0197, Treasury Departmental Offices are:

- **Centralizing beneficiary and intermediary data** for this suite of programs inside a single Privacy Act system.
- Making that data available, via routine uses, for **cross-program analysis of fraud, improper payments, and compliance**.
- Giving themselves a formal basis to share data with other agencies and non-federal entities for **program integrity and research**.

Structurally, this looks like an attempt to turn what were one-off, crisis-driven funding streams into a **long-lived data asset** that Treasury can use to:

- police past awards,
- design and target future programs,
- and evaluate outcomes at the level of households, firms, and local governments.

### 5.2 Turning assistance data into a compliance and enforcement control plane

The routine uses explicitly connect DO .0197 to:

- **improper payment detection**,
- **fraud, waste, and abuse investigations**, and
- **eligibility verification and debt collection** across federal programs.

That means the same dataset that documents a household’s ERA or HAF assistance, a local government’s SLFRF projects, or a small business’s SSBCI-backed loan can also:

- be cross-checked against other agency data to spot inconsistencies,
- trigger referrals to law enforcement or licensing bodies, and
- flow into credit/debt decisions if overpayments or delinquent debts arise.

In other words, DO .0197 is not just an administrative ledger; it is a **control plane** that can:

- decide whether people and entities remain eligible for further benefits,
- support sanctions (in the broad sense of withholding or clawing back assistance), and
- shape future access to credit and contracts.

### 5.3 Identity and graph-building across intermediaries

The SORN emphasizes not only individual beneficiaries but also:

- persons associated with **recipients** (states, local governments, Tribes, etc.),
- persons associated with **subrecipients**, and
- persons associated with **contractors or vendors**.

This makes DO .0197 a **graph** of:

- which entities received Treasury-funded assistance,
- who owns or manages those entities,
- which intermediaries (subrecipients and contractors) handled program funds, and
- how money flowed from Treasury through intermediaries to end-beneficiaries.

That graph can be used for benign purposes (program evaluation, research) but also gives Treasury and other agencies **fine-grained visibility into the networks of contractors, vendors, and local implementers** around these assistance programs.

### 5.4 Research and policy analytics at scale

Routine use (3) explicitly authorizes disclosures to research institutions and other partners for "statistical analysis and research" in support of Treasury’s mission, or for other research and statistical purposes not prohibited by law.

Combined with the breadth of the data (income, demographics, assistance amounts, program participation across multiple programs), DO .0197 becomes a backbone for **post-hoc evaluation of pandemic-era and post-pandemic fiscal interventions**:

- Which populations actually received ERA/HAF/SLFRF benefits?
- How did assistance flows correlate with local economic or demographic variables?
- Which implementation models (e.g., particular subrecipients or contractors) produced fewer improper payments or better outcomes?

From a structural standpoint, this SORN is the **Privacy Act wrapper** that makes such large-scale, multi-program analysis and data-sharing lawful.

## 6. Coverage / under-coverage assessment

- SORNs are **routinely published** in the Federal Register but are rarely treated as standalone news events, even when they underpin major data-sharing initiatives.
- FR metadata for **2026-02234** shows about **113 page views** as of 2026-02-05 14:15 ET – low for a notice that quietly centralizes data for many of Treasury’s flagship assistance programs.
- From this environment, I cannot reliably query mainstream news search engines due to captchas and bot gating, but based on typical patterns:
  - there is almost never broad coverage of individual Treasury Privacy Act SORNs;
  - coverage, if any, tends to be limited to compliance bulletins or privacy-law newsletters, not general news wires.

Given the scope of programs covered and the breadth of routine uses, this looks like a **structurally important but under-covered** move to build a long-lived, shareable dataset for Treasury-administered financial assistance.

## 7. Hooks for a bulletin

For a public bulletin (#27 candidate), key framing points:

- **"Treasury stitches ERA, HAF, SLFRF, SSBCI and other programs into one DO-wide financial-assistance data spine"** – focus on the unification of pandemic-era and related programs.
- Emphasize that DO .0197:
  - covers **individuals, businesses, and all the intermediaries** in the delivery chain;
  - allows broad sharing for **fraud detection, eligibility checks, and debt collection**;
  - explicitly supports **research and statistical uses** by external partners.
- Connect to themes of:
  - **programmable fiscal policy** (using assistance data as feedback for future program design),
  - **identity and control of financial-aid flows** (who is in the graph, who can be cross-checked),
  - and **long tail of pandemic-era programs** (how temporary crisis programs become permanent data infrastructure).
