  <h2>24. Congress hard-codes BOEM’s Gulf of America lease sale to a 2020 Gulf template via the One Big Beautiful Bill Act</h2>

  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-05 (Federal Register publication) &mdash; <strong>Regulator:</strong> Department of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) &mdash; <strong>Document:</strong> Final Notice of Sale for <em>Gulf of America (GOA) Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas One Big Beautiful Bill Act Lease Sale 2 (Lease Sale BBG2)</em>, <strong>FR Doc 2026-02289</strong>, 91 FR 5251&ndash;5259, Docket <strong>BOEM-2025-0516</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Core move:</strong> Congress, through the <strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)</strong>, forces BOEM to hold a new <strong>Gulf of America</strong> offshore oil and gas lease sale on a fixed schedule and to reuse the <strong>exact lease form, lease terms, economic conditions, and stipulations</strong> from a prior Gulf of Mexico sale &mdash; <em>Region-Wide Oil and Gas Lease Sale 254</em> (85 FR 8010, Feb. 12, 2020). Instead of letting BOEM update the lease package for 2026 policy and climate realities, OBBBA <strong>time-locks</strong> the parameters to a 2020 snapshot, while simultaneously rebranding the region from the <em>Gulf of Mexico</em> to the <em>Gulf of America</em> under Executive Order 14172.</p>

  <h3>How OBBBA rewires the leasing control plane</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mandated sale with frozen parameters.</strong> Section 50102 of OBBBA requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct <strong>Lease Sale BBG2</strong> within a specified window and to offer the same lease form, terms, economic conditions, and stipulations used in <strong>Lease Sale 254</strong>. That makes the statute not just a high-level authorization, but a piece of <strong>resource-allocation code</strong> that dictates the contractual knobs BOEM must use, limiting its discretion to tighten fiscal terms, adjust environmental stipulations, or integrate newer risk and climate assessments.</li>

    <li><strong>Gulf of America branding layered on Gulf of Mexico instruments.</strong> The notice is published under the new <strong>Gulf of America (GOA)</strong> name, following Executive Order 14172, <em>“Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness”</em>. Yet it must keep "Gulf of Mexico" in official titles (like the 2020 Lease Sale 254 NOS at 85 FR 8010). The result is a dual regime where the operational layer speaks of the Gulf of America, but the underlying legal references and lease template remain anchored in <strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong>–branded instruments.</li>

    <li><strong>Fixed geography with carved-out sanctuaries and withdrawals.</strong> BOEM offers all available, unleased acreage in the GOA OCS except for long lists of <strong>withdrawn whole and partial blocks</strong>. The tables enumerate areas pulled from leasing by the <strong>September 8, 2020 Presidential Memorandum</strong> (Pensacola, Destin Dome, DeSoto Canyon, Henderson protraction areas) and by the <strong>Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary</strong> (East and West Flower Garden Banks and Stetson Bank). Even as Congress pushes an aggressive new sale, these historic withdrawals and sanctuary boundaries persist as <strong>hard exclusions</strong> in the leasing grid.</li>

    <li><strong>Concrete logistics and access constraints.</strong> Bids must arrive via delivery service or in-person at BOEM’s New Orleans office (1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard), and public bid opening takes place at a separate Kenner venue (4545 Williams Boulevard) with <strong>limited in-person seating restricted to bidders</strong>. Everyone else watches via <strong>live-stream</strong> at <code>https://www.boem.gov/Sale-BBG2</code>. That splits the sale into a physically constrained room for decision-makers and a broadly visible but <strong>view-only digital surface</strong> for markets and the general public.</li>

    <li><strong>Collision with dynamic climate and tax instruments.</strong> Elsewhere in the same Federal Register issue, Treasury/IRS is implementing <strong>IRC &sect;45Z clean fuel production credits</strong>, turning lifecycle emissions tables into a sliding-scale carbon price. By contrast, OBBBA’s BBG2 mandate <strong>freezes 2026 offshore leases to 2020 terms</strong>. Structurally, that creates a split control plane: tax and climate policy try to continuously steer capital toward cleaner fuels, while this statute pins at least one major offshore sale to legacy lease economics and stipulations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why this matters</h3>
  <p>FR Doc <strong>2026-02289</strong> is a clear case of Congress using statute to <strong>micromanage the executive’s leasing parameters</strong> for a specific offshore sale. It hard-codes a historical Gulf of Mexico lease template into a renamed Gulf of America sale, limits BOEM’s ability to update leases for evolving climate and environmental priorities, and shows how prior Presidential withdrawals and marine sanctuaries continue to shape which blocks can ever be offered. Taken together, OBBBA’s lease-parameter lock, the symbolic renaming, and the preserved exclusions make Lease Sale BBG2 a textbook example of how law, branding, and geography combine to govern who can extract which resources, on what terms, and for how long.</p>

  <h3>Coverage / under-coverage</h3>
  <p>Searches for combinations of <em>"Gulf of America"</em>, <em>"One Big Beautiful Bill Act"</em>, and <em>"Lease Sale 2"</em> surfaced official BOEM materials and some political commentary on OBBBA, but I did not find early mainstream coverage that unpacks the <strong>parameter-lock back to Lease Sale 254</strong> or the way preexisting withdrawals and sanctuaries shape the sale area. Within normal search and captcha limits, I treat this as <code>LIKELY_UNDERCOVERED_BOEM_GULF_OF_AMERICA_OBBBA_LEASE_SALE_2</code> and rely on the Federal Register notice, the Lease Sale 254 record, and the local mirror as primary sources.</p>
