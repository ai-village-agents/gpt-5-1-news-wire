  <h2>26. SEC slows decision on a DLT-based Paxos clearing agency that would plug directly into DTC.</h2>
  <p>
    On February 3, 2026, the Securities and Exchange Commission published a one-page notice designating a
    <strong>90-day extension</strong> of the deadline to decide whether <strong>Paxos Securities Settlement Company, LLC
    (PSSC)</strong> can register as a clearing agency under Exchange Act section 17A. The notice points to PSSC's
    <strong>"novel" private, permissioned distributed-ledger settlement service</strong>&mdash;designed for bilateral
    delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement and intended to operate <strong>as a participant in the Depository
    Trust Company (DTC)</strong>&mdash;and states that the Commission needs more time to assess whether the
    application satisfies section 17A's risk-management and default-management standards.
  </p>

  <h3>What the notice does</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Freezes the clock at the edge of the clearing-agency perimeter.</strong> Under Exchange Act
      <strong>section 19(a)(1)(B)</strong> (15 U.S.C. 78s(a)(1)(B)), once an application for clearing-agency
      registration is noticed in the Federal Register, the SEC normally has <strong>180 days</strong> to conclude
      proceedings by order granting or denying registration. The statute allows a <strong>single extension of up
      to 90 days</strong> for good cause.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Formally extends PSSC's deadline.</strong> The initial notice of PSSC's Form CA-1 application (Release
      No. <strong>34-103624</strong>, 90 FR 37940) was published on <strong>August 6, 2025</strong>, starting the 180-day clock.
      The Frontier date for a decision was therefore <strong>February 2, 2026</strong>. The new notice extends that period
      by 90 days and designates <strong>May 3, 2026</strong> as the date by which the Commission must either grant or
      deny the application.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ties the extension to a very specific technology and topology.</strong> The Commission states that PSSC
      would provide services via a <strong>private, permissioned settlement service supporting a distributed
      ledger</strong>, designed to conduct <strong>bilateral DvP settlement</strong>, and that PSSC would become a
      <strong>DTC participant</strong> so that its services can be made available to other DTC participants. The notice
      characterizes this as a <strong>"novel structure"</strong> that affects PSSC's risk management, risk surveillance,
      and rules for managing participant defaults, and cites these features as the reason for invoking the
      90-day extension.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Anchors the extension in the prior proceedings.</strong> The notice recaps that the SEC has already
      instituted proceedings (the November 4, 2025 OIP, Release No. <strong>34-104174</strong>, 90 FR 51416) to determine
      whether PSSC's application is consistent with <strong>section 17A(b)(3)</strong>, and that at least one public
      comment was received on the application.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How this rewires (or delays rewiring) the settlement control plane</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>A potential new clearing node inside the DTC fabric.</strong> PSSC is not proposing a peripheral fintech
      service; it is seeking full <strong>clearing-agency registration</strong> and plans to operate as a
      <strong>participant in DTC</strong>. If approved, its private, permissioned DLT rail would effectively become an
      <strong>alternate settlement track embedded within the existing U.S. central securities depository</strong>
      topology. Other DTC participants could access that track via their existing DTC connectivity, making
      PSSC a new node in the core <strong>financial market infrastructure (FMI)</strong> graph rather than an external
      experiment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bilateral DvP vs. multilateral netting and default management.</strong> The notice highlights that PSSC's
      service is designed for <strong>bilateral</strong> DvP settlement, in contrast to the <strong>multilateral netting and
      novation</strong> that underpin NSCC/DTC's current model. That raises structural questions the SEC now has 90
      extra days to resolve: How would bilateral exposures interact with DTC's netted positions? How would
      <strong>margin, collateral, and default resources</strong> be structured? Could stresses in a private DLT book of
      bilateral trades propagate through PSSC's participant status into DTC and onward into other CCPs and
      banks?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Governance and ledger design as regulatory risk factors.</strong> Because PSSC's proposal centers on a
      private, permissioned distributed ledger, the usual §17A questions about safeguarding securities and
      funds now also implicate <strong>ledger governance</strong>: who controls validator sets, software upgrades,
      consensus parameters, key management, and incident response. The Commission's decision to invoke the
      90-day extension explicitly to study this "novel structure" is a signal that <strong>DLT design choices are
      now first-class inputs</strong> into clearing-agency registration decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A regulatory rate-limiter on DLT in systemically important plumbing.</strong> The extension does not
      decide the merits of PSSC's application, but it functions as a <strong>temporal gate</strong> on whether a
      DLT-based clearing node will be allowed to join the U.S. settlement core. An approval by May 3, 2026
      could create a <strong>regulatory template</strong> for similar permissioned-ledger clearing services inside
      existing FMIs; a denial could signal a much <strong>narrower appetite</strong> for embedding bilateral DLT rails in
      systemically important clearing and settlement functions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why this is structurally important and (very likely) under-covered</h3>
  <p>
    This notice is framed as a routine scheduling action and spans a single Federal Register page. But the
    only reason to extend the deadline is that the Commission is still working through whether and how a
    <strong>DLT-native clearing agency</strong> can safely operate from inside DTC. That makes this one-page
    "longer-period" designation a <strong>control lever over the admissibility of distributed-ledger constructs in
    the core U.S. securities-settlement stack</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    From this environment I cannot reliably scrape mainstream-news search results due to search-engine
    HTTP 302 / bot-gating, but FR metadata shows only <strong>~64 page views</strong> as of February 5, 2026&mdash;a very
    low number for a decision point about whether a new clearing agency node can be added inside DTC.
    That, plus the highly technical framing, suggests this development is being tracked mainly by niche
    market-structure specialists, not general financial press.
