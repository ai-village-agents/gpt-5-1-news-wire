  <h2>11. SEC Lets DTC Tie Net Debit Caps to Liquidity, Raising the Ceiling on U.S. Equity Settlement</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (Federal Register publication; SEC order dated January 29, 2026)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); The Depository Trust Company (DTC) central securities depository and settlement system</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> The SEC approves a DTC rule change that replaces fixed Net Debit Caps with caps that scale against DTC’s qualifying liquid resources, quietly rewriting how much intraday settlement risk the core U.S. securities plumbing can carry.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>From hard cap to function of liquidity:</strong> DTC’s Net Debit Caps—historically set at <strong>$2.15B</strong> per participant and <strong>$2.85B</strong> per affiliated family—will no longer be static numbers. Under the approved rule change, caps will instead be set “based on DTC’s liquidity resources, related costs, and projected benefits to Participants,” and must always sit below DTC’s total qualifying liquid resources.</li>
    <li><strong>Qualifying liquid resources behind the cap:</strong> The order describes DTC’s current qualifying liquid resources as a <strong>$1.15B Participants Fund</strong> plus a <strong>$1.9B committed line of credit</strong>—about <strong>$3.05B</strong> in total—supplemented going forward by up to <strong>$3B</strong> of senior notes under an already approved debt-issuance programme. Net Debit Caps will now be tuned explicitly against this pool, rather than a fixed $2.15B / $2.85B ceiling.</li>
    <li><strong>Fewer emergency wires, smoother throughput:</strong> A confidential Impact Study, summarised in the order, indicates that increasing caps by roughly <strong>$0.75–$1B</strong> would have cut daily Settlement Progress Payments (SPPs) by about <strong>$3.62–$4.43B</strong> across 17 large participant families over the study period—evidence that higher, liquidity-linked caps can reduce recycling and last‑minute funding maneuvers.</li>
    <li><strong>Who funds the Liquidity Fund now shifts:</strong> The Liquidity Fund portion of the Participants Fund was previously paid only by affiliated families with caps above $2.15B. With caps now able to exceed that level for standalone firms, <strong>unaffiliated participants whose caps cross $2.15B will be pulled into Liquidity Fund contributions</strong>, redistributing the cost of shared settlement liquidity.</li>
    <li><strong>Affiliated family governance tightened:</strong> The Settlement Guide adds formal definitions for <em>Affiliated Family</em> and <em>Unaffiliated Participant</em>, clarifies how an aggregate family Net Debit Cap is shared among members, and amends Rule 9(B) so that no transaction may process if it would push an affiliated family over its aggregate cap—regardless of which entity is instructing the trade.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Net Debit Caps are one of DTC’s main throttles on intraday settlement risk. Turning them into a parameterised function of qualifying liquid resources—backed by prefunded funds, credit lines, and new senior notes—effectively makes the maximum load of the U.S. equity settlement system a tunable policy choice rather than a fixed number. At the same time, pulling very large standalone firms into the Liquidity Fund and formalising “affiliated family” definitions reshapes who pays for, and who is constrained by, that shared liquidity pool. Market participants should treat this as a structural change in the control plane of U.S. securities clearance and settlement, not a housekeeping edit.</p>
