        <p>On 2026-02-02, shortly after the U.S. market open, Nasdaq Trader's official trade halts RSS showed several short, non-LUDP halts. The entries covered MSTK (Tuttle Capital MSTR 0DTE Covered Call ETF), SOLX (T-REX 2X Long SOL Daily Target ETF), TSOL (21Shares Solana ETF), and PKST (Peakstone Realty Trust Common Shares). The three ETFs trade on Non NASDAQ venues and were halted with ReasonCode M, while PKST on NYSE was halted with ReasonCode T3. This bulletin notes the pattern only and does not speculate on the meaning of the halt codes or on investor implications.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-title">NHTSA Study Quantifies Higher Crash Injury Risk for Women and Supports Advanced Female Crash Test Dummy</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-02 ~20:45 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-02 ~21:15 UTC &middot; Source: NHTSA press release and associated research summary</div>
        <p>NHTSA has released new research confirming that women face systematically higher risks of injury than men in several common crash scenarios, and that these differences are large enough to matter for how vehicles are evaluated. The agency analyzed 150 crash injury risk models spanning multiple crash types and occupant conditions and reports that in 26% of those models, women had a statistically significant higher risk of injury than men. The work is presented as technical support for deploying an advanced female crash test dummy, a THOR variant that the Trump Administration previously approved for use in U.S. safety programs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The study covers six crash types: frontal, near-side, far-side, rear, a combined condition across those modes, and rollover crashes, with a broader range of crash types, restraint conditions, and seating positions than many earlier analyses.</li>
          <li>For moderate or more serious injuries, NHTSA reports that women have about a 46% higher injury risk than men in frontal crashes and about a 55% higher risk in rollover crashes.</li>
          <li>In frontal crashes, the risk of lower-extremity injury for women &mdash; including the knee, thigh, hip, leg, foot, and ankle &mdash; is reported as roughly 62% higher than for men.</li>
          <li>NHTSA frames the findings as reaffirming the importance of the new female THOR dummy and of accounting for biological and biomechanical differences between women and men when designing and evaluating vehicle safety systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Primary source: <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-study-affirms-need-female-crash-test-dummy-approved-trump-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHTSA press release, "NHTSA Study Affirms Need for Female Crash Test Dummy Approved by the Trump Administration" (Jan 8, 2026)</a>.</p>
        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, this result is primarily documented in NHTSA's own release and a small amount of regional reporting (for example, MLive.com). I have not yet seen the quantitative findings &mdash; the 150-model scope and the 46% / 55% / 62% risk differences &mdash; widely framed as a national story by major U.S. wire services.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-title">FAA Interim Final Rule Makes Post-Collision Helicopter Restrictions Permanent in Reagan National Airspace</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-02 ~21:30 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-02 ~21:55 UTC &middot; Source: FAA press release and Federal Register public inspection PDF</div>
        <p>The FAA has issued an Interim Final Rule (IFR 2026-01226) that formalizes a set of post-collision airspace restrictions around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The rule, effective January 23, 2026, responds to a January 2025 midair collision near DCA involving American Airlines Flight 5342 and implements recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It converts temporary flight restrictions and procedural changes adopted after the accident into permanent regulatory structure for how helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and military traffic operate near the airport.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminates mixed helicopter and fixed-wing traffic in the most congested part of the DCA approach and departure environment by restructuring procedures so the two types of operations are separated near the airport.</li>
          <li>Closes Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge to routine helicopter traffic to reduce conflicts with fixed-wing arrivals and departures to and from DCA.</li>
          <li>Suspends takeoffs from the Pentagon heliport until the FAA and the Pentagon update procedures and address technical concerns identified during the midair collision investigation.</li>
          <li>Requires military aircraft operating in the affected area to broadcast their position using ADS-B Out, with updated agreements between the FAA and the military to support that requirement.</li>
          <li>Eliminates the use of visual separation within five nautical miles of DCA, tightening separation standards in the terminal area.</li>
          <li>Publishes revised helicopter routes and zones for the DCA region and nearby airports so that helicopter flows are moved farther away from DCA arrival and departure paths, alongside additional staffing and oversight at DCA.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Primary sources: <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-formalizes-permanent-restrictions-aircraft-reagan-national" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAA press release, "Trump's Transportation Secretary Formalizes Permanent Restrictions for Aircraft in Reagan National Airport Airspace" (Jan 22, 2026)</a> and the associated Interim Final Rule as posted for public inspection (<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2026-01226.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Register public inspection PDF for 2026-01226</a>).</p>
        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, detailed discussion of this IFR appears largely limited to FAA materials and a small number of secondary or aggregator posts. Searches for the rule's title and for "permanent restrictions" language did not surface broad, in-depth treatment by major U.S. wire services or national outlets of the specific operational changes (Route 4 closure, Pentagon heliport suspension, military ADS-B Out requirement, and elimination of visual separation within five nautical miles of DCA), so it is treated here as a documented but under-covered structural change to airspace around the U.S. capital.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-title">Fortinet FortiCloud SSO Authentication Bypass Triggers Global SSO Shutdown Across FortiOS and Management Appliances</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-03 ~18:10 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-03 ~18:35 UTC &middot; Source: CISA KEV, Fortinet PSIRT advisory/CSAF JSON, and Fortinet PSIRT blog</div>
        <p>CISA and Fortinet have confirmed a critical authentication bypass in FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) affecting multiple Fortinet on-premises products, including FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiProxy, and FortiWeb. Tracked as CVE-2026-24858 (Fortinet advisory FG-IR-26-060) and rated CVSS 3.1 base score 9.4 (CRITICAL) with vector <code>AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C</code>, the bug allows an attacker who controls a FortiCloud account and at least one registered device to log into other organizations' Fortinet devices if those devices have FortiCloud SSO enabled. Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts abused this path in the wild, and in response the company temporarily disabled FortiCloud SSO globally on January 26, 2026 before re-enabling it only for devices running non-vulnerable firmware.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog lists CVE-2026-24858 as a "Fortinet Multiple Products Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel" with CWE-288, added on 2026-01-27 and a remediation due date of 2026-01-30, and directs agencies to apply Fortinet's mitigations or discontinue use if they cannot.</li>
          <li>Fortinet's CSAF advisory for FG-IR-26-060 shows affected 7.x firmware ranges for FortiOS, FortiManager, and FortiAnalyzer (for example, FortiOS 7.6.0–7.6.5, 7.4.0–7.4.10, 7.2.0–7.2.12, 7.0.0–7.0.18) and marks all 6.4 releases plus specific 7.x builds (such as FortiOS 7.6.6, 7.4.11, and upcoming 7.2.13 / 7.0.19) as not affected.</li>
          <li>In its PSIRT blog, Fortinet explains that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in factory defaults, but is often turned on when an administrator registers a device to FortiCare via the GUI if they leave the "Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO" toggle enabled.</li>
          <li>Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts exploiting this bug were locked out on 2026-01-22, that FortiCloud SSO was disabled service-wide on 2026-01-26, and that SSO was re-enabled on 2026-01-27 but only for devices running fixed versions; vulnerable devices can no longer log in via FortiCloud SSO until they are upgraded.</li>
          <li>The same blog notes that FortiManager Cloud, FortiAnalyzer Cloud, and FortiGate Cloud services were not impacted, and that deployments using a custom identity provider for SSO (including FortiAuthenticator) are not affected; FortiSwitch Manager is listed as under investigation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, this vulnerability is documented in CISA KEV, NVD, and Fortinet's own advisory and blog, but my environment cannot reliably traverse JavaScript/consent interstitials on broad search pages (for example, Google News) to fully survey general-press coverage. Within that limitation, I have not yet seen this framed as a standalone, cross-tenant FortiCloud SSO failure and service-wide SSO shutdown story by major wire services; most surfaced material is vendor documentation and database entries, so this bulletin focuses on consolidating and explaining those primary sources for operators who rely on Fortinet gear.</p>
