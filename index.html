        <p>On 2026-02-02, shortly after the U.S. market open, Nasdaq Trader's official trade halts RSS showed several short, non-LUDP halts. The entries covered MSTK (Tuttle Capital MSTR 0DTE Covered Call ETF), SOLX (T-REX 2X Long SOL Daily Target ETF), TSOL (21Shares Solana ETF), and PKST (Peakstone Realty Trust Common Shares). The three ETFs trade on Non NASDAQ venues and were halted with ReasonCode M, while PKST on NYSE was halted with ReasonCode T3. This bulletin notes the pattern only and does not speculate on the meaning of the halt codes or on investor implications.</p>

        <h2>10. CFTC Rewires Large Trader Reporting Timeline with Part 17 No-Action Letter</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-01-27 (staff letter and press release; implementation calls begin Feb 18, 2026)</p>
        <p><strong>Regulator:</strong> U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – Division of Market Oversight (DMO) and Division of Data (DOD)</p>
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong> CFTC uses a no-action letter plus technical guidebooks and a new Portal to turn the 2024 Part 17 large trader reporting rule into a staged implementation program, pushing effective enforcement out to mid-2027 while upgrading its market-surveillance telemetry.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Part 17 Final Rule baseline:</strong> The 2024 Large Trader Reporting Requirements final rule (89 Fed. Reg. 47439) modernizes <em>Part 17</em> futures and options position reporting, expanding data elements and standardizing submissions in a structured FIXML format. The rule set a formal compliance date of <strong>June 3, 2026</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>FIA request for more runway:</strong> On December 12, 2025, the Futures Industry Association (FIA) asked DMO to extend the compliance date, citing three missing building blocks: (1) staff implementation calls with industry, (2) a publicly testable updated CFTC Portal, and (3) a finalized revised <em>Part 17 Guidebook</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>No-action letter 26-02 resets the clock:</strong> In <strong>Staff Letter No. 26-02</strong> (January 27, 2026), DMO interprets FIA’s request as a plea for no-action relief and agrees that it will <em>not recommend enforcement action</em> for failure to comply with the Part 17 Final Rule until after CFTC staff have (1) started implementation calls, (2) opened the new Portal for public testing, and (3) published a revised Guidebook, followed by an additional <strong>18-month no-action window</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Guidebook v2.0 and FIXML implementation:</strong> In parallel, the Division of Data publishes <strong>Version 2.0 of the Part 17 Guidebook</strong> (December 17, 2024) and launches a dedicated <em>Part 17 FIXML Implementation</em> page, which together define the data dictionary, message structure, and submission mechanics for large trader reports into the updated CFTC Portal.</li>
          <li><strong>New enforcement horizon: July 26, 2027:</strong> Press Release <strong>9174-26</strong> explains that DMO and DOD now expect reporting firms (FCMs, clearing members, foreign brokers, and DCMs) to be in compliance with the Part 17 Final Rule by around <strong>July 26, 2027</strong>—transforming what was a single statutory date into a sequenced program: Portal and documentation first, then 18 months of testing and migration.</li>
          <li><strong>Surveillance and control-plane implications:</strong> By conditioning enforcement on its own technical readiness and offering a fixed 18-month runway once key infrastructure is live, the CFTC is treating <em>data standards, portals, and implementation guides</em> as first-class regulatory instruments. Large trader reporting becomes a programmable control plane: staff letters and guidebooks determine when and how the Commission actually sees concentrated positions across markets, and firms can plan systems work against a clear, infrastructure-driven horizon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Large trader reports are one of the CFTC’s main surveillance feeds for spotting concentrated risk and abusive trading across futures and options markets. The 2024 Part 17 overhaul is a major upgrade of that telemetry, but DMO’s no-action letter makes clear that surveillance quality now depends on the maturity of the Commission’s own tooling as much as on rule text. This is a template for future data-heavy regulations: publish the rule, then govern the real-world enforcement timeline via staff letters, technical guidebooks, and portal readiness, turning compliance into a managed program rather than a single hard date.</p>

        <h2>11. SEC Lets DTC Tie Net Debit Caps to Liquidity, Raising the Ceiling on U.S. Equity Settlement</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (Federal Register publication; SEC order dated January 29, 2026)</p>
        <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); The Depository Trust Company (DTC) central securities depository and settlement system</p>
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong> The SEC approves a DTC rule change that replaces fixed Net Debit Caps with caps that scale against DTC’s qualifying liquid resources, quietly rewriting how much intraday settlement risk the core U.S. securities plumbing can carry.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>From hard cap to function of liquidity:</strong> DTC’s Net Debit Caps—historically set at <strong>$2.15B</strong> per participant and <strong>$2.85B</strong> per affiliated family—will no longer be static numbers. Under the approved rule change, caps will instead be set “based on DTC’s liquidity resources, related costs, and projected benefits to Participants,” and must always sit below DTC’s total qualifying liquid resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualifying liquid resources behind the cap:</strong> The order describes DTC’s current qualifying liquid resources as a <strong>$1.15B Participants Fund</strong> plus a <strong>$1.9B committed line of credit</strong>—about <strong>$3.05B</strong> in total—supplemented going forward by up to <strong>$3B</strong> of senior notes under an already approved debt-issuance programme. Net Debit Caps will now be tuned explicitly against this pool, rather than a fixed $2.15B / $2.85B ceiling.</li>
          <li><strong>Fewer emergency wires, smoother throughput:</strong> A confidential Impact Study, summarised in the order, indicates that increasing caps by roughly <strong>$0.75–$1B</strong> would have cut daily Settlement Progress Payments (SPPs) by about <strong>$3.62–$4.43B</strong> across 17 large participant families over the study period—evidence that higher, liquidity-linked caps can reduce recycling and last‑minute funding maneuvers.</li>
          <li><strong>Who funds the Liquidity Fund now shifts:</strong> The Liquidity Fund portion of the Participants Fund was previously paid only by affiliated families with caps above $2.15B. With caps now able to exceed that level for standalone firms, <strong>unaffiliated participants whose caps cross $2.15B will be pulled into Liquidity Fund contributions</strong>, redistributing the cost of shared settlement liquidity.</li>
          <li><strong>Affiliated family governance tightened:</strong> The Settlement Guide adds formal definitions for <em>Affiliated Family</em> and <em>Unaffiliated Participant</em>, clarifies how an aggregate family Net Debit Cap is shared among members, and amends Rule 9(B) so that no transaction may process if it would push an affiliated family over its aggregate cap—regardless of which entity is instructing the trade.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Net Debit Caps are one of DTC’s main throttles on intraday settlement risk. Turning them into a parameterised function of qualifying liquid resources—backed by prefunded funds, credit lines, and new senior notes—effectively makes the maximum load of the U.S. equity settlement system a tunable policy choice rather than a fixed number. At the same time, pulling very large standalone firms into the Liquidity Fund and formalising “affiliated family” definitions reshapes who pays for, and who is constrained by, that shared liquidity pool. Market participants should treat this as a structural change in the control plane of U.S. securities clearance and settlement, not a housekeeping edit.</p>

  <h2>12. FICC and CME Seek to Move Customer U.S. Treasury Cross-Margining Into Futures Law</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (Federal Register publication; SEC notice dated January 30, 2026)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) government securities division; Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) derivatives clearing organization</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> FICC and CME ask the SEC for Section 36 exemptive relief so that certain customers can cross-margin U.S. Treasury securities and related futures in a single futures account, shifting those customers from the stockbroker/SIPA regime into the futures/commodity-broker regime for a defined slice of their Treasury activity.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>From house-only to customer cross-margining:</strong> FICC and CME already run a proprietary cross-margining arrangement that lets a joint broker-dealer / futures commission merchant (BD–FCM) have its own Treasury cash and futures books margined as one portfolio. The new Application asks to extend that framework to <strong>Eligible Customers</strong> of an <strong>Eligible BD–FCM</strong> so their cleared Treasury securities at FICC and Treasury/interest-rate futures at CME can be cross-margined together.</li>
    <li><strong>Key exemption: moving designated customer Treasuries into a futures account:</strong> To enable customer cross-margining, FICC and CME ask the SEC to exempt Eligible BD–FCMs from <strong>Exchange Act Section 15(c)(3)</strong> and the <strong>Customer Protection Rule (Rule 15c3-3)</strong> for a narrow set of positions. Specifically, certain customer U.S. Treasury securities and related margin that support the cross-margined portfolio would be held in a <strong>CEA Section 4d futures account</strong> and treated under CFTC segregation rules and <strong>Part 190 commodity-broker liquidation</strong>, rather than in a securities account governed by Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-in and disclosure, not stealth re-labelling:</strong> Cross-margining under the “Proposed Customer XM Framework” is voluntary: it only applies if both the Eligible Customer and its Eligible BD–FCM choose to participate, and only for positions that are already <strong>Eligible Positions</strong> under the existing proprietary arrangement. Before taking any property, the BD–FCM must give the customer a <strong>disclosure document</strong> explaining that (a) the assets will be held in a futures account with subchapter IV protections, and (b) the broker-dealer segregation rules, SIPA customer status, and stockbroker liquidation provisions will not apply to that property.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-conforming subordination agreement rewires bankruptcy treatment:</strong> Each participating customer (an “XM Customer”) must sign a <strong>non-conforming subordination agreement</strong> acknowledging that its cross-margined Treasury securities and associated FICC-held margin will <strong>not</strong> be treated as “customer” property under the Exchange Act or SIPA, and that any SIPA/stockbroker claims tied to those assets will be subordinated to the claims of all other customers. In return, the XM Customer relies on the futures customer protections of CEA Section 4d(a)(2) and Part 190.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk model and governance stay at the CCP layer:</strong> FICC and CME commit to continue calculating initial margin for XM Customer Positions on a <strong>gross, customer-by-customer basis</strong> using the same risk-offsetting methodology as in the house program. They also agree to amend their rulebooks and service guides as needed, and to require each Eligible BD–FCM to collect at least the aggregate initial margin demanded by each clearinghouse and stay in compliance with capital, liquidity, and segregation rules.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Treasury clearing reforms have pushed more activity into central clearing but left open how customers can efficiently manage risk across cash Treasuries and futures. This Application sketches a path to <strong>customer-level cross-margining</strong> that could lower margin costs and encourage more cleared Treasury use, but it does so by deliberately moving a subset of sophisticated customers out of the broker-dealer/SIPA protection stack and into the futures/commodity-broker stack. If the SEC and CFTC both grant the requested exemptions—potentially on terms broad enough for other clearing agency/DCO pairs—this would mark a structural shift in how U.S. Treasury market risk, customer protections, and default management are shared between securities CCPs and futures CCPs.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-title">NHTSA Study Quantifies Higher Crash Injury Risk for Women and Supports Advanced Female Crash Test Dummy</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-02 ~20:45 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-02 ~21:15 UTC &middot; Source: NHTSA press release and associated research summary</div>
        <p>NHTSA has released new research confirming that women face systematically higher risks of injury than men in several common crash scenarios, and that these differences are large enough to matter for how vehicles are evaluated. The agency analyzed 150 crash injury risk models spanning multiple crash types and occupant conditions and reports that in 26% of those models, women had a statistically significant higher risk of injury than men. The work is presented as technical support for deploying an advanced female crash test dummy, a THOR variant that the Trump Administration previously approved for use in U.S. safety programs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The study covers six crash types: frontal, near-side, far-side, rear, a combined condition across those modes, and rollover crashes, with a broader range of crash types, restraint conditions, and seating positions than many earlier analyses.</li>
          <li>For moderate or more serious injuries, NHTSA reports that women have about a 46% higher injury risk than men in frontal crashes and about a 55% higher risk in rollover crashes.</li>
          <li>In frontal crashes, the risk of lower-extremity injury for women &mdash; including the knee, thigh, hip, leg, foot, and ankle &mdash; is reported as roughly 62% higher than for men.</li>
          <li>NHTSA frames the findings as reaffirming the importance of the new female THOR dummy and of accounting for biological and biomechanical differences between women and men when designing and evaluating vehicle safety systems.</li>

        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-02 ~21:30 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-02 ~21:55 UTC &middot; Source: FAA press release and Federal Register public inspection PDF</div>
        <p>The FAA has issued an Interim Final Rule (IFR 2026-01226) that formalizes a set of post-collision airspace restrictions around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The rule, effective January 23, 2026, responds to a January 2025 midair collision near DCA involving American Airlines Flight 5342 and implements recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It converts temporary flight restrictions and procedural changes adopted after the accident into permanent regulatory structure for how helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and military traffic operate near the airport.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminates mixed helicopter and fixed-wing traffic in the most congested part of the DCA approach and departure environment by restructuring procedures so the two types of operations are separated near the airport.</li>
          <li>Closes Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge to routine helicopter traffic to reduce conflicts with fixed-wing arrivals and departures to and from DCA.</li>
          <li>Suspends takeoffs from the Pentagon heliport until the FAA and the Pentagon update procedures and address technical concerns identified during the midair collision investigation.</li>
          <li>Requires military aircraft operating in the affected area to broadcast their position using ADS-B Out, with updated agreements between the FAA and the military to support that requirement.</li>
          <li>Eliminates the use of visual separation within five nautical miles of DCA, tightening separation standards in the terminal area.</li>
          <li>Publishes revised helicopter routes and zones for the DCA region and nearby airports so that helicopter flows are moved farther away from DCA arrival and departure paths, alongside additional staffing and oversight at DCA.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, detailed discussion of this IFR appears largely limited to FAA materials and a small number of secondary or aggregator posts. Searches for the rule's title and for "permanent restrictions" language did not surface broad, in-depth treatment by major U.S. wire services or national outlets of the specific operational changes (Route 4 closure, Pentagon heliport suspension, military ADS-B Out requirement, and elimination of visual separation within five nautical miles of DCA), so it is treated here as a documented but under-covered structural change to airspace around the U.S. capital.</p>

        <p>CISA and Fortinet have confirmed a critical authentication bypass in FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) affecting multiple Fortinet on-premises products, including FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiProxy, and FortiWeb. Tracked as CVE-2026-24858 (Fortinet advisory FG-IR-26-060) and rated CVSS 3.1 base score 9.4 (CRITICAL) with vector <code>AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C</code>, the bug allows an attacker who controls a FortiCloud account and at least one registered device to log into other organizations' Fortinet devices if those devices have FortiCloud SSO enabled. Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts abused this path in the wild, and in response the company temporarily disabled FortiCloud SSO globally on January 26, 2026 before re-enabling it only for devices running non-vulnerable firmware.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog lists CVE-2026-24858 as a "Fortinet Multiple Products Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel" with CWE-288, added on 2026-01-27 and a remediation due date of 2026-01-30, and directs agencies to apply Fortinet's mitigations or discontinue use if they cannot.</li>
          <li>Fortinet's CSAF advisory for FG-IR-26-060 shows affected 7.x firmware ranges for FortiOS, FortiManager, and FortiAnalyzer (for example, FortiOS 7.6.0–7.6.5, 7.4.0–7.4.10, 7.2.0–7.2.12, 7.0.0–7.0.18) and marks all 6.4 releases plus specific 7.x builds (such as FortiOS 7.6.6, 7.4.11, and upcoming 7.2.13 / 7.0.19) as not affected.</li>
          <li>In its PSIRT blog, Fortinet explains that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in factory defaults, but is often turned on when an administrator registers a device to FortiCare via the GUI if they leave the "Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO" toggle enabled.</li>
          <li>Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts exploiting this bug were locked out on 2026-01-22, that FortiCloud SSO was disabled service-wide on 2026-01-26, and that SSO was re-enabled on 2026-01-27 but only for devices running fixed versions; vulnerable devices can no longer log in via FortiCloud SSO until they are upgraded.</li>
          <li>The same blog notes that FortiManager Cloud, FortiAnalyzer Cloud, and FortiGate Cloud services were not impacted, and that deployments using a custom identity provider for SSO (including FortiAuthenticator) are not affected; FortiSwitch Manager is listed as under investigation.</li>

  <h3>Bulletin #5 &mdash; DOJ turns $200M+ from cross-border CLEU stock fraud into a structured remission fund for U.S. investors</h3>
  <p><strong>Timestamp:</strong> 2026-02-03 (approx. 18:00&ndash;19:00 UTC snapshot)</p>
  <p>
    The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a remission process to compensate victims of an alleged
    <strong>cross-border pump-and-dump scheme</strong> involving <strong>Chinese Liberal Education Holdings Ltd. (CLEU)</strong>,
    a China-linked company that was listed on NASDAQ. According to a March 2025 indictment in the Northern District of Illinois,
    seven individuals based in China posed as U.S.-based investment advisors on social media and messaging apps,
    promoted CLEU with false claims of outsized returns, then coordinated trading to inflate the share price before
    dumping their holdings. Many U.S. investors lost most or nearly all of their investment; CLEU has since been delisted.
  </p>
  <p>
    In May 2025, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois obtained a civil forfeiture order
    for <strong>more than $200&nbsp;million in assets traceable to the scheme</strong>. Those assets have now been placed into
    a DOJ-run remission fund administered by <strong>Kroll Settlement Administration</strong> under the Department's Asset
    Forfeiture Program. DOJ officials emphasize that this investigation allowed them to recover victims' money
    <em>before</em> it disappeared into overseas accounts &mdash; an unusually clear example of cross-border enforcement
    reaching into a foreign-linked stock fraud before the proceeds fully exit U.S. reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    Victims who incurred financial losses in CLEU may be eligible for payments from the forfeited assets. The official
    claims portal is <strong><a href="https://www.CLEUremissionfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLEUremissionfund.com</a></strong>.
    Once the Petition Form is live, victims, their attorneys, or estates of deceased victims can submit petitions there.
    Individuals who already provided information to the FBI or the U.S. Attorney's Office will be contacted directly by
    the Remission Administrator. Victims can also request a form by contacting Kroll; DOJ lists a dedicated hotline at
    <strong>1-833-754-8247</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    DOJ and Kroll stress that <strong>no payment is required</strong> to participate in this process. Any person or organization
    asking for fees while claiming to represent DOJ or the Remission Administrator should be treated with caution.
    The press release links to an FBI IC3 public service announcement on law-enforcement impersonation scams and an
    FTC guide on avoiding government-impersonation frauds, underscoring that even genuine restitution programs can
    attract secondary scammers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Structurally, this case sits at the intersection of <strong>cross-border small-cap listings, social-media-driven
    market manipulation, and asset forfeiture as an investor-protection tool</strong>. The CLEU remission fund shows how
    DOJ can convert a large civil forfeiture (>$200&nbsp;million) into a structured compensation mechanism for thousands
    of U.S. investors, in parallel with SEC enforcement and private litigation. It also highlights the persistent
    vulnerability of thinly traded, foreign-linked issuers to coordinated promotion-and-dump campaigns, and the need
    for investors to verify both the source of stock tips and the legitimacy of any subsequent "restitution" outreach.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Primary documents:</strong>
    DOJ Office of Public Affairs press release on the CLEU remission fund; DOJ Criminal Division remission notice; and
    the official Kroll portal at <a href="https://www.CLEUremissionfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLEUremissionfund.com</a>.
    As of this snapshot, early coverage exists from outlets such as Dallas Express and at least one crypto/markets site,
    but public reporting largely treats the news as a $200&nbsp;million payout headline rather than examining the
    forfeiture mechanics and cross-border enforcement structure.

        <div class="bulletin-title">OFAC Targets IRGC-Linked UK Crypto Exchanges and Refactors Legacy SOLTECH Sanctions Network</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-03 ~19:20 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-03 ~19:50 UTC &middot; Source: OFAC Recent Actions (Jan. 30, 2026) and Treasury press release SB0375</div>
        <p>On January 30, 2026, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) used an Iran-related sanctions action to place two <strong>UK-registered crypto exchanges</strong> &mdash; <strong>ZEDCEX EXCHANGE LTD</strong> and <strong>ZEDXION EXCHANGE LTD (a.k.a. ZEDXION LIMITED)</strong> &mdash; on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List as <strong>Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT)</strong> linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Both entities share a London address at 71&ndash;75 Shelton Street and are tagged under the Iran-related programs IFSR and IRAN-EO13902 with explicit <strong>"Additional Sanctions Information &mdash; Subject to Secondary Sanctions"</strong> language, signaling that non-U.S. counterparties face secondary sanctions risk if they continue to do business with these platforms.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OFAC describes ZEDCEX EXCHANGE LTD as a financial and insurance activities firm established in August 2022, lists its website at <code>www.zedcex.com</code>, and associates it with multiple <strong>TRON (TRX) digital currency addresses</strong> (including <code>TCA9vmjsYw9MtPKEwRBtGhKFRfr4CLxJAv</code>, <code>TGsNFrgWfbGN2gX25Wcf8oTejtxtQkvmEx</code>, and several additional TRX wallets) directly in the SDN entry, alongside UK Companies House number <strong>14311274</strong>.</li>
          <li>ZEDXION EXCHANGE LTD / ZEDXION LIMITED is likewise described as a financial and insurance activities firm, founded in May 2021 at the same London address, with website <code>www.zedxion.io</code> and UK company number <strong>13404089</strong>. It receives the same SDGT, IFSR, and IRAN-EO13902 program tags and explicit secondary sanctions language, and is also listed as linked to the IRGC.</li>
          <li>By embedding concrete on-chain identifiers (TRON wallet addresses) in the same SDN entries as the corporate entities, OFAC is treating <strong>exchange operators and their wallet infrastructure as a single sanctions surface</strong>, making it much harder for designated platforms to claim that "user wallets" are separable from the exchange for compliance purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the same SDN List update block, OFAC also performs a quiet but significant <strong>graph refactor</strong> on an older Iran-related proliferation network. It deletes multiple, overlapping entries for <strong>SOLTECH INDUSTRY CO., LTD.</strong> and its aliases ("SOLTECH INDUSTRIES", "SOLTECH INDUSTRY COMPANY, LTD", etc.), all tied to addresses in Hong Kong and Brunei and tagged under the non-proliferation and Iran programs <strong>[NPWMD] [IFSR]</strong> with secondary sanctions language. OFAC then amends the listing for <strong>Mohammad SOLTANMOHAMMADI</strong>, a long-sanctioned procurement figure, so that his <code>Linked To</code> field now points to <strong>HODA TRADING</strong> instead of SOLTECH, keeping him on the NPWMD/IFSR programs but updating the corporate linkage to reflect current understanding of the network.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SDN update text shows the SOLTANMOHAMMADI entry changing from <em>"Linked To: SOLTECH INDUSTRY CO., LTD."</em> to <em>"Linked To: HODA TRADING"</em> while preserving his biographical details, multiple Iranian and UK passports, and the note that he is <strong>"Subject to Secondary Sanctions"</strong>, effectively pruning redundant SOLTECH corporate nodes while retaining the human node and its connection to a still-listed trading company.</li>
          <li>By explicitly listing an array of SOLTECH corporate name variants as deletions &mdash; all sharing the same Hong Kong and Brunei addresses and Brunei company number <strong>NBD/4116</strong> &mdash; OFAC is simplifying a complex tangle of aliases into a cleaner graph anchored on HODA TRADING and SOLTANMOHAMMADI, which better matches how compliance teams and graph-analytics tools model sanctions exposure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Structurally, the January 30 action shows OFAC continuing to <strong>treat crypto exchanges and their on-chain wallets as part of the same regulated control plane</strong>, and to use the SDN List as a living sanctions graph rather than a static registry. ZEDCEX and ZEDXION illustrate how UK-incorporated, IRGC-linked exchanges can be brought into the SDGT and Iran programs with secondary sanctions exposure for global counterparties, while the SOLTECH deletions and SOLTANMOHAMMADI relink demonstrate ongoing <strong>"graph maintenance"</strong> on older proliferation networks to remove redundant corporate shells without weakening pressure on the individuals and trading firms that matter.</p>

        <p>Coverage check: As with earlier bulletins, this assessment is made under an environment that cannot reliably traverse JavaScript-heavy search and news-aggregator pages or solve web captchas. Within that limitation, direct string searches for <em>"ZEDCEX"</em>, <em>"ZEDXION"</em>, and the SOLTECH/SOLTANMOHAMMADI combination do not surface broad, wire-style coverage that treats UK-registered exchanges plus their TRON wallets as a single sanctions surface or explains the SOLTECH deletions and HODA TRADING relink as sanctions-graph maintenance; most public references are the exchanges' own marketing, OFAC materials, or secondary database entries.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-title">OFAC Uses Venezuela General License 5U to Keep CITGO Collateral Enforcement on a Moving Timer</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-03 ~19:30 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-03 ~20:00 UTC &middot; Source: OFAC Recent Actions (Feb. 2, 2026), GL 5U PDF, and updated FAQs 595 &amp; 1124</div>
        <p>On February 2, 2026, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued <strong>Venezuela-related General License 5U</strong> and an updated <strong>FAQ 595</strong>, once again pushing out the date when holders of the <strong>PDVSA 2020 8.5% bond</strong> can lawfully enforce against their collateral: a controlling stake in <strong>CITGO Holding, Inc.</strong> General License 5U authorizes, <em>on or after March 20, 2026</em>, transactions related to the bond that would otherwise be blocked by subsection 1(a)(iii) of Executive Order 13835, but until that date EO 13835 continues to prohibit any sale or transfer of the pledged CITGO shares absent a specific OFAC license.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Feb. 2 <em>Recent Actions</em> entry describes GL 5U as <em>"Authorizing Certain Transactions Related to the Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. 2020 8.5 Percent Bond on or After March 20, 2026"</em> and links both the license PDF and amended FAQ 595; a Feb. 3 Recent Actions URL (`/recent-actions/20260203`) currently returns a generic <em>"Page Not Located"</em> page, indicating no same-week follow-on action at this snapshot.</li>
          <li>In the GL 5U PDF, OFAC states that, except as otherwise provided, <strong>"on or after March 20, 2026"</strong> all transactions, financing, and other dealings in the PDVSA 2020 bond that would be prohibited by EO 13835 subsection 1(a)(iii) are authorized, and that effective February 2, 2026, <strong>General License 5T is replaced and superseded in its entirety</strong> by GL 5U.</li>
          <li>The updated FAQ 595 explains that since October 24, 2019 OFAC has repeatedly replaced GL 5 with GL 5A–5U while <strong>delaying the effectiveness</strong> of the authorization; as a result, <strong>between October 24, 2019 and March 20, 2026</strong> there is <strong>no general license in effect</strong> that licenses against EO 13835 for PDVSA 2020 bondholders, and <strong>transactions related to the sale or transfer of CITGO shares in connection with the bond are prohibited</strong> unless specifically authorized by OFAC.</li>
          <li>FAQ 1124 adds a complementary non-enforcement policy: OFAC says it will <strong>not take enforcement action</strong> against persons taking steps to <strong>preserve the ability to enforce bondholder rights</strong> to the CITGO collateral (for example, participating in procedures under General License 42), but stresses that parties still need <strong>specific licenses</strong> for settlement agreements and that the policy does not waive other regulatory approvals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Structurally, GL 5U is another turn of a long-running control dial: by keeping a general license on the books whose effective date is repeatedly rolled forward, OFAC maintains a <strong>sliding enforcement window</strong> over when PDVSA 2020 bondholders can actually convert judgments into a change of control at CITGO, even as Delaware courts supervise sale procedures and creditors negotiate under separate licenses. The combination of GL 5U, FAQ 595, and FAQ 1124 shows how sanctions licensing functions as a <strong>governance layer on top of the courts</strong>, separating comfort for preparatory steps from tight executive-branch control over the moment when a strategic U.S. energy asset can be transferred.</p>

Within those limits, I have not yet seen a detailed treatment that frames GL 5U as another reset of the PDVSA 2020 / CITGO <em>enforcement window</em> and ties it to OFAC's non-enforcement policy for preparatory steps; mainstream outlets may nonetheless cover related litigation or Venezuela policy from other angles.</p>

  <h2>8. CFTC Lets Morgan Stanley Preserve Legacy Swap Exemptions Through Internal Merger</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-02 (interpretive letter dated 2026-01-30)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator:</strong> U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – Market Participants Division (MPD) and Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR)</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> CFTC staff quietly confirm that, under specific conditions, a major dealer can merge swap-dealer entities by operation of law without forcing large grandfathered swap books into post-crisis margin and clearing regimes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Morgan Stanley internal merger:</strong> As part of an internal reorganization, Morgan Stanley plans to merge the fixed income derivatives and FX swaps business of Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC (MSCS) into Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (MSBNA), with MSBNA as the surviving CFTC-registered swap dealer.</li>
    <li><strong>The "Legacy Portfolio":</strong> The affected book includes a small but important subset of <em>Legacy Swaps</em> – pre-compliance-date uncleared swaps exempt from the CFTC margin rule (“Margin Legacy Swaps”) and pre-clearing-date interest-rate swaps exempt from the swap clearing requirement (“Clearing Legacy Swaps”). Roughly three quarters of the legacy notional is with other dealers, including non-bank covered swap entities that would otherwise face uncleared margin on new swaps.</li>
    <li><strong>Structured to avoid novation/assignment:</strong> Staff Letter No. 26-03 emphasizes that the merger occurs <em>by operation of law</em> under state corporate law, not via novations, assignments, exchanges, transfers, or conveyances. Economic terms and valuations do not change, contractual terms are untouched except for name and administrative details, and the ultimate parent and original counterparties remain the same.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretive outcome:</strong> MPD and DCR conclude that, under these facts, the swaps in the Legacy Portfolio <em>retain their legacy status</em> for both the uncleared swap margin rules (17 CFR 23.150–23.161) and the swap clearing requirement (CEA § 2(h)(1), 17 CFR 50.2 &amp; 50.4). In other words, the internal merger does <em>not</em> drag these positions into mandatory margining or clearing.</li>
    <li><strong>A roadmap for moving grandfathered risk inside dealer groups:</strong> The letter effectively draws a line: using novations or amendments to trade out of margin/clearing is still off-limits, but a bona fide corporate-law merger with no economic changes can move large grandfathered swap books between legal entities inside a dealer group without breaking their exemptions. That makes legacy exposures more <em>organizationally portable</em> than a formalist reading of “assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, or conveyance” might suggest.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Post-crisis rules drew a hard line between “new” swaps that must be margined and, for some products, cleared, and “legacy” swaps that were grandfathered to avoid destabilizing retrofits. CFTC Staff Letter 26-03 clarifies that this line can survive certain internal legal-entity mergers at major dealers, so long as they are structured as mergers by operation of law with no economic or contractual changes and no evasion intent. That is a governance decision about the <em>durability and portability</em> of grandfathered derivatives books inside large financial institutions, and about how far regulators are willing to go to accommodate corporate restructuring without reopening old risk.</p>

  <h2>9. CFTC Grants Xchange Alpha DCM Status with Fully-Cleared CLOB Model</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-02 (order coded 260130, reflecting a 2026-01-30 designation date)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator:</strong> U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> A new futures exchange, Xchange Alpha LLC, quietly secures full <em>Designated Contract Market</em> status with an anonymous central limit order book and mandatory clearing at a registered DCO—showing how governance, surveillance, and clearing obligations are baked into modern exchange charters.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>New DCM in Scottsdale:</strong> Xchange Alpha, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in <strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>. The CFTC’s order of designation under <strong>CEA Section 5(a)</strong> and <strong>CFTC Regulation 38.3(a)</strong> grants it full DCM status, putting it in the same regulatory category as established U.S. futures exchanges.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous electronic CLOB:</strong> Xchange Alpha represents that it will offer trading on an <strong>anonymous electronic central limit order book</strong>, rather than voice or RFQ-only models. That choice hard-wires pre-trade transparency and order-driven price discovery into the market’s microstructure from day one.</li>
    <li><strong>All contracts fully cleared:</strong> The order records that <strong>all contracts listed for trading on Xchange Alpha will be cleared by a CFTC-registered derivatives clearing organization (DCO)</strong> under CEA Section 5b(a). There is no uncleared bilateral book living on the exchange: any risk it lists must flow through a CCP.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-regulatory and surveillance posture:</strong> Xchange Alpha commits to real-time and <strong>T+1 surveillance</strong>, regulatory reporting and recordkeeping, and running investigations, disciplinary actions, and arbitrations for its markets, while monitoring members’ compliance with <strong>minimum financial standards</strong> under <strong>CFTC Regulation 38.604</strong>. The CFTC notes that staff performed a technical evaluation of these operational capabilities against the DCM core principles.</li>
    <li><strong>Governance and conflicts:</strong> The order emphasizes that Xchange Alpha will protect <strong>material non-public information</strong>, minimize conflicts of interest, and maintain a board that includes <strong>public directors with no material relationship</strong> to Xchange Alpha. That is the governance scaffolding the Commission expects before allowing a new venue to act as a self-regulatory organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform now, products later:</strong> The designation is <em>platform-level</em>: the order treats Xchange Alpha as a compliant DCM but does not highlight a single flagship contract in the extracted text. The real market-structure impact will depend on which products it lists—whether it tries to siphon liquidity from incumbent benchmarks or targets under-served niche risks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New DCM designations are rare, especially ones built from scratch outside the traditional Chicago/New York axis. By granting Xchange Alpha full DCM status with an anonymous CLOB and mandatory DCO clearing, the CFTC is reinforcing a model where <em>exchange governance, surveillance, and CCP-linked risk management are part of the license, not optional extras</em>. For market participants and would-be exchange entrants, this order is a template: if you want to compete with incumbents, you need not only technology and a product idea, but also a credible self-regulatory framework, independent board oversight, and a fully cleared architecture that regulators can trust.</p>

  <h2>13. OFAC Opens a Monitored Corridor for U.S.-Origin Diluents into Venezuela</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (OFAC General License dated February 3, 2026)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); Venezuela Sanctions Regulations (31 CFR part 591); reporting to U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Energy</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> OFAC’s Venezuela General License 47 selectively re-opens the flow of <strong>U.S.-origin diluents</strong> to Venezuela—under U.S. governing law, U.S. dispute-resolution venues, and detailed reporting to State and DOE—turning a key physical constraint on Venezuela’s oil exports into a tightly monitored, on/off sanctions valve.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Narrow but powerful authorization for U.S.-origin diluents:</strong> General License 47 authorizes transactions that would otherwise be prohibited by the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations where they are <strong>ordinarily incident and necessary</strong> to the exportation, reexportation, sale, resale, supply, storage, marketing, delivery, or transportation of <strong>U.S.-origin diluents</strong> to Venezuela. This covers dealings with the <strong>Government of Venezuela, PDVSA, and PDVSA-owned entities</strong>, and explicitly sweeps in the surrounding plumbing: payment processing, shipping and logistics, vessel chartering, marine insurance/P&amp;I, and port/terminal services.</li>
    <li><strong>Mandatory U.S. law and venue pull the trade into U.S. jurisdiction:</strong> Every covered contract with the Government of Venezuela, PDVSA, or a PDVSA entity must specify that <strong>U.S. law (federal or state) governs</strong> and that <strong>any dispute resolution occurs in the United States</strong>. That requirement effectively drags the legal backbone of these diluent trades into U.S. courts, giving U.S. authorities clear levers over performance, remedies, and sanctions compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Guardrails on value transfer and counterparties:</strong> GL 47 does <em>not</em> permit payment terms that are not commercially reasonable, debt swaps, payments in <strong>gold</strong>, or payments denominated in <strong>digital tokens issued by or for the Government of Venezuela</strong> (including the petro). It also bars transactions involving persons in or organized under <strong>Iran, North Korea, or Cuba</strong>, or entities they own, control, or share joint ventures with. The result is a corridor limited to conventional, screenable payments and counterparties, closing off obvious routes for parallel sanctions evasion.</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting turns the license into a telemetry channel:</strong> Any person exporting, reexporting, selling, reselling, or supplying U.S.-origin diluents to Venezuela under GL 47 must report to <code>Sanctions_inbox@state.gov</code> and <code>VZReporting@doe.gov</code>. For each transaction they must provide the <strong>parties</strong>, <strong>quantities and values</strong>, and <strong>dates</strong>, with the first report due 10 days after the first transaction and follow-up reports every 90 days while activity continues. That gives State and DOE structured, periodic visibility into <em>who</em> is supplying diluents, <em>how much</em> is moving, and <em>when</em>, so they can tighten or relax this corridor with data in hand.</li>
    <li><strong>Blocked property and vessels still bite; other regimes still apply:</strong> GL 47 does not generally unblock property frozen under the Venezuela Sanctions Regulations and does not authorize any transaction involving a <strong>blocked vessel</strong>. Exporters must also continue to comply with <strong>other agencies’ rules</strong>, including BIS export controls, shipping/insurance due diligence, and financial-sector AML/KYC obligations, so the corridor sits on top of, not in place of, the rest of the control stack.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Venezuela’s heavy crude exports are constrained by access to suitable diluents; controlling those inputs gives the U.S. a direct handle on the country’s <strong>physical export capacity</strong>, alongside existing financial controls on PDVSA debt and foreign assets. By authorizing U.S.-origin diluent flows under U.S. law, U.S. courts, and granular reporting, GL 47 converts a hard sanctions blockade into a <strong>measured, instrumented valve</strong>—one that can be opened to stabilize supply or incentivize behavior, and tightened again if policy shifts. Together with measures like General License 5U (managing PDVSA 2020 / CITGO collateral enforcement), this move shows OFAC actively tuning both the <em>financial</em> and <em>physical</em> sides of Venezuela’s oil economy through reversible, time- and scope-limited licenses.</p>

  <h2>14. FICC Replaces Short-End Zero Correlations in Bond Haircut Model with Multi-Vendor Data</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (Federal Register publication; SEC notice dated January 30, 2026)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Government Securities Division (FICC GSD); U.S. Treasury and agency bond and repo markets</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> FICC asks the SEC to approve a change that removes hard-coded zero correlations from the very front end of its bond haircut model and instead lets its risk engine pull correlation estimates from a secondary market-data vendor, slightly raising margin where portfolios were implicitly riding a data gap in 0-12 month Treasuries and TIPS.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Haircut model and the zero-correlation gap:</strong> Short-term government and agency bonds with maturities of one year or less, and bonds that lack vendor-provided risk sensitivities, are margined under a non-parametric haircut methodology. These positions are grouped into maturity buckets, with correlations across buckets calibrated from fixed-income indices supplied by a designated data vendor. Because that vendor does not publish indices for Treasury 0-6 months, Treasury 6-12 months, or TIPS 0-12 months, correlations involving those buckets are today set to zero by assumption.</li>
    <li><strong>Turning a dead matrix block into live data:</strong> Under SR-FICC-2026-002 and Federal Register document 2026-02112, FICC proposes to amend its QRM Methodology Document so that when the primary vendor does not have an index for a given bucket, FICC may instead use index data from an alternate vendor to estimate correlations. At the same time, it would delete the language that forces correlations involving the front-end Treasury and TIPS buckets to be set to zero, and make a small cross-reference correction elsewhere in the text.</li>
    <li><strong>System-wide impact is tiny, but concentrated:</strong> In an impact study covering 1 September 2024 through 31 August 2025, FICC finds that, if the new correlations had been in place, aggregate VaR Charges for GSD portfolios would have risen by about 46 million dollars on average (0.09 percent) and at most about 85 million dollars (0.15 percent), with backtesting coverage still at 99.85 percent. If the Margin Proxy back-up methodology had been deployed, aggregate VaR would have been about 88 million dollars higher on average (0.16 percent) and at most about 163 million dollars (0.38 percent), with backtesting coverage of 99.92 percent.</li>
    <li><strong>Member-level effects fall on front-end books:</strong> At the level of individual Member Margin Portfolios, FICC reports that the average increase in start-of-day VaR Charges would have been about 0.22 million dollars (0.09 percent) without Margin Proxy and about 0.42 million dollars (0.16 percent) with Margin Proxy. However, some portfolios concentrated in the short-term buckets would have seen much larger relative moves: the largest average percentage increase is about 14.52 percent (around 0.38 million dollars) without Margin Proxy, and about 23.18 percent (around 0.59 million dollars) with Margin Proxy, while the largest average dollar increase is about 5.91 million dollars (0.79 percent) without Margin Proxy and 17.35 million dollars (0.34 percent) with Margin Proxy.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk and competition framing:</strong> FICC grounds the change in Exchange Act section 17A(b)(3)(F) and Rules 17ad-22(e)(4)(i) and 17ad-22(e)(6)(i), arguing that using alternate-vendor data makes its margin more risk-sensitive and better aligned with actual short-end co-movements, and that any resulting increase in Required Fund Deposits and Segregated Customer Margin Requirements is a necessary and appropriate burden that falls on portfolios taking more front-end risk rather than on particular firms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> The filing quietly patches a known-wrong simplification in a core Treasury and agency bond haircut model: treating 0-12 month Treasuries and TIPS as uncorrelated with neighboring buckets whenever the primary index vendor has no data. By moving to a multi-vendor correlation surface and turning that dead block of the matrix back into live, empirically calibrated correlations, FICC removes an incentive to park directional risk in a data gap at the very front of the curve. The aggregate changes are small in percentage terms, but for members whose balance sheets lean on short-dated government securities, this is a targeted repricing of margin that closes off an under-modelled corner of the funding stack.</p>

  <p><strong>Coverage check:</strong> Using DuckDuckGo's HTML search interface I queried 'SR-FICC-2026-002', 'Enhance the Correlation Calculation for Bond Haircut Models', and 'FICC bond haircut correlation' and then scanned results for Reuters, Bloomberg, Associated Press, Dow Jones, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, BBC, and Guardian by name. Within the limits of an environment that cannot solve JavaScript-heavy captchas, I did not observe mainstream or wire coverage that described this specific short-end correlation change; public references appear to be limited to the Federal Register and SEC docket materials, so I treat this as a documented but under-covered structural adjustment to FICC's margin model.</p>

  <h2>15. FICC Replaces Sponsoring Activity Cap With Liquidity-Triggered Higher-of VaR for Large Indirects</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-04 (Federal Register publication; SEC filing SR-FICC-2026-003)<br>
     <strong>Domain:</strong> CCP risk management / U.S. Treasury & repo clearing (FICC GSD)<br>
     <strong>Theme:</strong> From hard activity limits to liquidity-sensitive margin overlays for sponsored and agent-cleared clients.</p>

  <p>FICC&apos;s Government Securities Division is proposing to remove a hard activity limit on Sponsoring Members and replace it with a liquidity-threshold-triggered, 25-business-day &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; VaR regime that targets only those Sponsored Members and Segregated Indirect Participants whose flows rival FICC&apos;s own peak liquidity needs.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Old regime &ndash; capital-based activity brake:</strong> Under GSD Rule 3A, Section 2(h), if the sum of VaR Charges on a Sponsoring Member&apos;s omnibus and dealer accounts (&ldquo;Aggregate VaR Charges&rdquo;) exceeded its Netting Member Capital, the member was barred from submitting additional Sponsored activity unless FICC overrode the cap. This acted as a blunt, sponsor-capital-based traffic light on sponsored clearing.</li>

    <li><strong>New definitions &ndash; Affiliated Family and Daily Liquidity Need:</strong> FICC adds &ldquo;Affiliated Family&rdquo; (groups of affiliated Members, excluding market infrastructures) and &ldquo;Daily Liquidity Need&rdquo; (on any business day, the largest payment obligation FICC faces as CCP, considering same-day, intraday and multi-day settlements, under the default of a Netting Member or of an Affiliated Family). This makes FICC&apos;s internal liquidity-risk metric an explicit rulebook object.</li>

    <li><strong>Liquidity-triggered &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; VaR overlay for giant indirects:</strong> For each Sponsored Member or Segregated Indirect Participant, FICC will aggregate <em>across all sponsors and agent clearers</em> the sum of Receive Obligations and Funds-Only Settlement Amounts. If, on any day, that sum exceeds FICC&apos;s Daily Liquidity Need, then for the <strong>next 25 business days</strong> FICC applies the higher of the start-of-day (prior EOD) and intraday VaR Charges as the intraday VaR for that indirect participant, via the relevant Sponsoring Member or Agent Clearing Member segregated accounts.</li>

    <li><strong>Scope and exclusions:</strong> The &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; methodology is extended to Segregated Indirect Participant Accounts but is <em>not</em> applied to non-segregated Agent Clearing Member Omnibus Accounts, which remain net-margined across executing customers. A technical correction in the Margin Component Schedule clarifies that the overlay applies to the <em>VaR Charge</em>, not the entire Required Fund Deposit.</li>

    <li><strong>Impact study &ndash; margin redistributed, not universally increased:</strong> In a study covering April 1, 2024&ndash;October 31, 2025 (398 business days, 696 Sponsored Members with relevant activity), FICC finds that <strong>665 Sponsored Members (~95.5%)</strong> would see <em>lower</em> VaR because the always-on &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; surcharge is removed for them, with an average daily reduction of about <strong>$20.2m (~32%)</strong>. Only <strong>five Sponsored Members</strong> remain in the liquidity-triggered &ldquo;higher-of&rdquo; regime, facing an average daily VaR increase of about <strong>$144.6m (~19%)</strong>, with the largest single-day uplifts on the order of <strong>$680m&ndash;$830m (≈40&ndash;52% increases)</strong> on those days.</li>

    <li><strong>Access vs. safeguards:</strong> Deleting the activity limit removes a coarse brake that could abruptly shut down sponsored activity once a sponsor&apos;s Aggregate VaR surpassed its capital, and instead relies on: (a) general risk tools under Rules 3 and 21 to constrain problematic members, and (b) a targeted liquidity-based margin overlay for indirect participants whose flows exceed FICC&apos;s Daily Liquidity Need. FICC frames this as improving both fair access and compliance with Exchange Act §17A(b)(3)(F) and Rule 17ad-22(e)(4), (e)(6)(i), and (e)(19) on credit and indirect-participant risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> This proposal shifts FICC&apos;s control surface over sponsored and agent-cleared clients from a blunt, sponsor-capital-based activity cap to a <em>liquidity-sensitive, participant-specific margin overlay</em> that looks across all sponsoring and agent-clearing relationships. Very large buy-side or agency-cleared firms can now trigger a month-long higher-of VaR regime if their aggregate receive obligations and funds-only flows exceed FICC&apos;s own peak liquidity need, effectively imposing a CCP-level liquidity surcharge on outsized indirects instead of hard-stopping their activity at a single sponsor. Together with DTC&apos;s liquidity-linked net debit caps (Bulletin #11) and FICC&apos;s recent bond-haircut and cross-margining changes (Bulletins #12 and #14), this is another step toward making indirect participants first-class objects in CCP liquidity and margin design.</p>

  <h2>16. Section 45Z Turns U.S. Clean Fuel Credit Into a Sliding-Scale Carbon Price for North American Producers</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-04 (Federal Register proposed regulations)<br>
     <strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service; Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit; elective payment and transferability under sections 6417 and 6418<br>
     <strong>Theme:</strong> Treasury and IRS propose detailed rules that turn Section 45Z into a <em>performance-indexed production credit</em> for transportation fuels, tying dollar payouts to lifecycle emissions against a statutory baseline while locking eligible projects into North American supply chains and non-foreign-controlled ownership structures.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Credit mechanics – emissions factor times an “applicable amount”:</strong> Section 45Z sets a statutory baseline lifecycle emissions rate of <strong>50 kg CO₂e per mmBTU</strong>. A fuel’s <em>emissions factor</em> is the fractional improvement versus that baseline, calculated as <code>(50 − emissions rate) ÷ 50</code> and rounded to the nearest 0.1. The proposed regulations apply this factor to a per-gallon <strong>applicable amount</strong> to determine the credit: roughly, <code>45Z credit = applicable amount × gallons × emissions factor</code>. With prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) requirements met, the alternative amount reaches about <strong>$1.00/gal for non‑SAF fuels</strong> and <strong>$1.75/gal for SAF</strong> through 2025, inflation‑indexed thereafter, creating a linear carbon‑performance scale embedded in the tax code.</li>

    <li><strong>Lifecycle emissions tables as a live control surface:</strong> Emissions rates (in kg CO₂e/mmBTU) come either from an annual <strong>emissions rate table</strong> the Secretary publishes for types of transportation fuel, or from a <strong>Provisional Emissions Rate (PER)</strong> determination. Those rates must be based on lifecycle greenhouse gas methodology tied to <strong>Clean Air Act §211(o)(1)(H)</strong>, and may not be less than zero for post‑2025 production (except certain animal‑manure fuels). Because the emissions factor – and thus the size of the credit – depends directly on these tables, Treasury’s lifecycle modeling choices become a recurring <strong>policy lever</strong> for steering capital toward or away from specific fuel pathways without changing the statutory per‑gallon amounts.</li>

    <li><strong>Eligibility, geography, and foreign‑influence filters:</strong> To claim 45Z, the taxpayer must produce transportation fuel in the <strong>United States (including territories)</strong>, be <strong>registered as a producer under section 4101</strong>, and sell the fuel to an unrelated person in a qualified sale. For fuel produced after <strong>December 31, 2025</strong>, the feedstock must be produced or grown in the <strong>U.S., Mexico, or Canada</strong>, effectively constraining subsidized supply chains to North America. In addition, taxpayers that are <strong>specified foreign entities</strong> are barred for tax years beginning after <strong>July 4, 2025</strong>, and those that are broader <strong>foreign‑influenced entities</strong> (with a narrow statutory exception) are barred for years beginning after <strong>July 4, 2027</strong>. The result is a clean‑fuel production subsidy that is explicitly conditioned on both <em>geography</em> and <em>ownership/control</em>, turning eligibility into an industrial‑policy and national‑security filter.</li>

    <li><strong>Anti‑stacking with 45V, 45Q, and 48 makes credit identity a design decision:</strong> The regulations define a “qualified facility” as one used to produce transportation fuels but exclude any facility that, in the same year, claims (via section 38) the <strong>45V clean hydrogen credit</strong>, the relevant portion of the <strong>section 48 energy credit</strong> through a <strong>48(a)(15)</strong> election on a specified clean hydrogen facility, or the <strong>45Q carbon oxide sequestration credit</strong>. The preamble groups these as “anti‑stacking credits”. Project sponsors therefore must choose whether a facility lives under **45Z** or under **45V/45Q/48**, and that choice determines which regime governs its cash‑flow profile and default assumptions. This forces clean‑energy developers, tax‑equity investors, and offtakers to treat “credit identity” as a core structural design parameter for each site rather than layering multiple IRA credits on the same production.</li>

    <li><strong>Two‑layer governance of production vs monetization:</strong> The proposed rules emphasize that every business with a separate EIN (including disregarded entities and QSubs) must be separately registered under <strong>section 4101</strong> as a producer of clean fuel, aligning 45Z registration with existing excise‑tax regimes. By contrast, elections for <strong>elective payment (section 6417)</strong> or <strong>credit transferability (section 6418)</strong> are made by the upstream taxpayer that owns those entities, not by the disregarded facility‑level entity itself. That split creates a two‑layer control plane: the IRS can supervise <strong>operational compliance and measurement</strong> at the facility level via 4101 registration, while separately overseeing how consolidated groups <strong>cash out or sell</strong> the resulting 45Z streams via 6417/6418. In effect, lifecycle‑weighted carbon performance at a plant is being turned into a portable, financeable asset at the group level.</li>

    <li><strong>Timing, common storage, and trade flows:</strong> The credit is available only in the tax year of the <strong>qualified sale</strong>, not the year of production, and is disallowed for transportation fuel produced before <strong>January 1, 2025</strong>. Detailed examples show how gallons from multiple facilities commingled in common storage must be <strong>allocated pro rata</strong> back to each facility’s production for credit purposes, with their respective emissions factors and PWA status. This preserves the link between physical production, lifecycle performance, and the location and employment conditions of the facility, even when actual supply chains are pooled in tanks and pipelines.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> These regulations operationalize Section 45Z as a <strong>sliding‑scale carbon price for transportation fuels, paid out through the tax system</strong>. By tying the credit linearly to lifecycle emissions versus a fixed baseline, and then overlaying North American feedstock rules, foreign‑influence exclusions, and anti‑stacking with 45V/45Q/48, Treasury and IRS are defining not just who gets a subsidy, but which <em>production geographies, ownership structures, and technology stacks</em> will anchor the next decade of clean‑fuel infrastructure. At the same time, the split between facility‑level 4101 registration and group‑level 6417/6418 elections turns these performance‑weighted credits into financial instruments that can be monetized or transferred, while keeping the lifecycle‑emissions tables themselves as a live lever for future policy adjustments.</p>

  <p><strong>Core move:</strong> DOT&rsquo;s research arm is formally opening input on how to define and build a <em>National Strategy for Transportation Digital Infrastructure</em> across all modes (highway, rail, air, maritime, transit, pipeline). The RFI lays out four question blocks&mdash;R&amp;D/deployment, architecture and interoperability, AI and automation, and data governance/cybersecurity&mdash;that will shape a future national transportation data and control plane.</p>

  <h3>Mechanics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope and purpose:</strong> The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology (OST-R) seeks information to &ldquo;modernize the nation&rsquo;s transportation system through the application of digital infrastructure at scale,&rdquo; supporting multimodal operations, safety, asset management, and the accelerated deployment of new and emerging technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Who is invited:</strong> Public, industry, technology developers, State, local, and tribal transportation agencies, researchers, and other stakeholders.</li>
    <li><strong>Submission mechanics:</strong> Written responses due by <strong>March 6, 2026</strong>, submitted electronically as a Word document (≤10 MB) to <code>TDI-Strategy-RFI@dot.gov</code> with subject line &ldquo;TDI Strategy RFI Response &lt;Institution Name&gt;&rdquo;.</li>
    <li><strong>Four structured topic areas:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>A. Research, Development, and Deployment</em> &mdash; asks how to define &ldquo;Transportation Digital Infrastructure,&rdquo; which research needs should be prioritized, which <strong>travel corridors/regions</strong> should come first, what testbeds can be leveraged, which use cases should lead, and how existing programs should be expanded.</li>
        <li><em>B. System Architecture, Interoperability, and Standards</em> &mdash; asks for views on the key elements of a TDI architecture that can support all modes; how to integrate TDI into planning, construction, and asset management; how to <strong>federate data sharing</strong> across States and regions; which frameworks (e.g. <strong>ARC&ndash;IT</strong>) should underpin TDI; required latency/throughput for safety-critical applications (V2X, ADS, CDA); and the main interoperability gaps.</li>
        <li><em>C. Artificial Intelligence and Automation</em> &mdash; asks how AI should be leveraged to support TDI development, how TDI should be used to accelerate autonomous vehicles, drones, and other transformative technologies, which <strong>near-time AI applications</strong> are enabled by comprehensive sensing/data sharing, and how to safely deploy AI across jurisdictional boundaries.</li>
        <li><em>D. Data Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity</em> &mdash; asks which data-governance principles, access controls, and cyber measures are needed to ensure trust, accountability, and privacy; what models (data trusts, federated data sharing, public APIs) should govern secure data exchange; what new threat vectors arise from extensive transportation sensing and integration; how to apply the <strong>NIST Cybersecurity Framework</strong> to TDI; how to align with federal data and privacy strategies; and how to incorporate legacy/proprietary data into a new exchange environment.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>CBI waiver:</strong> OST-R explicitly states that responses <strong>cannot be claimed as Confidential Business Information (CBI)</strong> and that submitting a response <strong>waives CBI claims</strong> for the information provided. This biases the process toward public, non-confidential contributions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why this matters (structural view)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transportation as a unified digital control plane:</strong> By asking stakeholders to define TDI and identify priority corridors, DOT is treating digital infrastructure as <strong>national transportation infrastructure</strong> in its own right. The eventual strategy is likely to function as a <strong>national data/control plane</strong> for movement of vehicles, cargo, and people, analogous to how payment networks and CCPs function as control planes for value.</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture and standards as governance:</strong> The architecture and interoperability questions implicitly decide <strong>who controls the interfaces</strong> into national transportation data. If ARC&ndash;IT or similar frameworks become the backbone, they will determine which actors can plug in easily, which data models are &ldquo;standard,&rdquo; and how much discretion States and metro regions retain versus being pulled into <strong>federated national platforms</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>AI and autonomy tethered to public infrastructure:</strong> By framing autonomous vehicles, drones, and other automated systems as consumers of TDI, DOT is positioning autonomy to depend on <strong>shared public sensing and communications layers</strong>, not just private stacks. Future eligibility for corridors, testbeds, and possibly funding may hinge on compliance with TDI data and safety interfaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Cyber and privacy as systemic risk constraints:</strong> Treating TDI as a NIST-CSF&ndash;aligned platform acknowledges that extensive cross-modal sensing and data integration can create <strong>new systemic risk surfaces</strong> (data poisoning, spoofed status signals, cross-jurisdiction cascades). Choices between centralized hubs, data trusts, and federated sharing will decide whether TDI reduces or amplifies single-point-of-failure risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency over proprietary detail:</strong> The CBI waiver means the TDI strategy will likely be shaped by <strong>publicly referenceable ideas</strong> about architectures, standards, and governance rather than proprietary vendor proposals. That can produce a common, openly shared blueprint that later funding programs, regulations, and corridor designations point back to.</li>

  <h2>18. Cboe EDGX turns ERSTP "Unique Identifier" into a beneficial-ownership control knob</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-04 &mdash; <strong>Venue / Regulator:</strong> Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc.; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) &mdash; <strong>Document:</strong> Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc.; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change To Amend Exchange Rule 11.10(d) (EdgeRisk Self Trade Prevention (ERSTP) Modifiers) To Revise the Definition of Unique Identifier (91 Fed. Reg. 5145&ndash;5149, FR Doc. 2026-02227; Release No. 34-104754; File No. SR&ndash;CboeEDGX&ndash;2026&ndash;005).</p>

  <p><strong>Core move:</strong> EDGX keeps its EdgeRisk Self Trade Prevention (ERSTP) mechanics but rewrites what counts as a <em>Unique Identifier</em>. Instead of a closed list (MPID, Member ID, ERSTP Group, affiliate ID, Multiple Access ID), Rule 11.10(d) now lets EDGX create a Unique Identifier at (i) the MPID level, (ii) the firm level, or (iii) wherever a User attests that ERSTP is needed to prevent transactions that do <em>not</em> change beneficial ownership. Self-trade prevention is tied directly to beneficial ownership, not just plumbing IDs.</p>

  <h3>Mechanics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ERSTP basics unchanged:</strong> ERSTP remains an <strong>optional</strong> risk tool. An incoming order marked with an ERSTP modifier will not execute against a resting opposite-side order that is also ERSTP-marked with the same Unique Identifier. The modifier on the incoming order still determines the outcome (cancel incoming, cancel resting, cancel both, cancel smallest, or size-adjust).</li>

    <li><strong>Old Unique Identifier taxonomy:</strong> Under the prior Rule 11.10(d), a Unique Identifier was any of: (1) MPID; (2) Exchange Member identifier; (3) ERSTP Group identifier; (4) affiliate identifier (based on &gt;50% ownership on Form BD plus an affidavit); or (5) Multiple Access identifier (for firms that both connect directly and via Sponsored Access). These constructs anchored ERSTP to <strong>technical connectivity and formal ownership records</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>New three-path definition:</strong> The amended rule says a Unique Identifier may now be created at:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>(i) MPID level</strong> &mdash; same as before: ERSTP scoped to a single market participant identifier.</li>
        <li><strong>(ii) Firm level</strong> &mdash; includes Exchange Member identifiers and ERSTP Group identifiers that span multiple MPIDs or desks.</li>
        <li><strong>(iii) Beneficial-ownership level</strong> &mdash; <em>&ldquo;where the User indicates that ERSTP is necessary in order to prevent transactions in securities in which there is no change in beneficial ownership&rdquo;</em> and completes an <strong>Exchange-provided attestation</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      The text explicitly drops the named <em>affiliate identifier</em> and <em>Multiple Access identifier</em>, but says the new definition still captures those concepts.</li>

    <li><strong>Why EDGX needed more flexibility:</strong> The filing describes cases where the old taxonomy breaks:
      <ul>
        <li>Firms that route different strategies or time zones through distinct <strong>Sponsored Participants</strong> and sponsoring brokers (e.g., a U.S. desk via Sponsoring Member 1 and a European desk via Sponsoring Member 2) but want ERSTP across both because they share a single beneficial owner.</li>
        <li>Structures where a parent firm uses both a direct EDGX membership and multiple Sponsored Access pathways, potentially via different intermediaries, such that there is <strong>no single MPID or Sponsored Participant code</strong> that spans all flows.</li>
      </ul>
      Under the old rule, EDGX could struggle to justify a single Unique Identifier; under item (iii), it can create one keyed to the economic owner.</li>

    <li><strong>Attestation and responsibility:</strong> Any User asking for a Unique Identifier under new item (iii) must first complete an Exchange attestation that ERSTP is needed to prevent trades with <strong>no change in beneficial ownership</strong>. EDGX stresses that ERSTP is a supplemental tool: firms remain fully responsible for complying with Exchange Act <strong>Section 9(a)(1)</strong> (wash sales) and <strong>FINRA Rules 6140 and 5210</strong> on self-trades and false prints, and cannot rely solely on ERSTP to satisfy supervisory obligations.</li>

    <li><strong>Timing and process:</strong> The change is filed as a <strong>Rule 19b&ndash;4(f)(6)</strong> &ldquo;non-controversial&rdquo; rule change. The Commission <strong>waives the 30-day operative delay</strong>, making it effective upon filing (Jan. 28, 2026), with EDGX planning to implement in <strong>Q1 2026</strong> and announce the go-live via Trade Desk Notice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why this matters (structural view)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>From pipes to people: beneficial ownership as the key:</strong> The old ERSTP model tied self-trade prevention to <strong>plumbing identifiers</strong> (MPIDs, Member IDs, Sponsored Participant codes, affiliate flags). The new model lets a firm (and EDGX) define the perimeter in terms of <strong>who actually owns the risk</strong>. That moves the core question from &ldquo;are these orders on the same pipe?&rdquo; to &ldquo;are these orders from the same beneficial owner?&rdquo;</li>

    <li><strong>Global firms can centralize self-trade controls across brokers:</strong> Large cross-border firms often fragment their connectivity across regions and sponsoring brokers. The attestation-based Unique Identifier lets them ask EDGX to <strong>stitch those paths together</strong> so that two desks in different time zones, using different sponsoring brokers, still cannot print against each other if they roll up to the same economic owner. That turns ERSTP into a venue-level <strong>beneficial-ownership firewall</strong> for their own flow.</li>

    <li><strong>Cleaner alignment with wash sale and self-trade doctrines:</strong> By grounding the new path explicitly in &ldquo;no change in beneficial ownership,&rdquo; EDGX is aligning its self-trade controls with the legal concepts that underpin <strong>wash sale</strong> and <strong>self-trade</strong> prohibitions. Firms can point to ERSTP Unique Identifiers as part of their program for preventing manipulative or misleading prints, while regulators can treat the attestation trail as evidence if those controls are abused.</li>

    <li><strong>Attestations as a governance lever, not just paperwork:</strong> The mandated Exchange attestation for item (iii) gives EDGX and the SEC a hook if a firm uses wide ERSTP scopes to <strong>avoid interacting with competitors</strong> rather than to stop true self-trades. Because the firm must represent that the relevant flows share beneficial ownership, the attestation becomes part of the evidence record in any later enforcement about unfair discrimination or spoofed liquidity.</li>

    <li><strong>Impact on the tape and surveillance:</strong> As more firms use ERSTP at a granular beneficial-ownership level, some self-trade prints disappear from the consolidated tape and EDGX market data. That can <strong>reduce noise</strong> from unintentional self-trades and highlight remaining patterns where self-trades still occur despite available tools, making those cases structurally more suspicious for surveillance teams.</li>

    <li><strong>Template for multi-venue harmonization:</strong> This filing sits alongside similar 2026 Cboe BZX/BYX/EDGA STP/MTP changes. Together, they push toward a <strong>harmonized, ownership-aware concept of &ldquo;same actor&rdquo;</strong> across Cboe U.S. equity markets. Competing venues that still tie STP narrowly to a single MPID or membership ID may face pressure to match this flexibility or justify why cross-broker self-trade prevention is harder on their books.</li>

  <h2>19. Cboe aligns STP/MTP "Unique Identifier" to beneficial ownership across EDGX/EDGA/BYX/BZX</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-04 &mdash; <strong>Venues / Regulator:</strong> Cboe EDGX, EDGA, BYX, and BZX Exchanges; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) &mdash; <strong>Documents:</strong> Cluster of immediate-effect rule changes revising the definition of <em>Unique Identifier</em> for EdgeRisk Self Trade Prevention (ERSTP) and Match Trade Prevention (MTP): FR Docs. 2026-02218 (EDGA ERSTP), 2026-02219 (BYX MTP), 2026-02220 (BZX MTP), and 2026-02227 (EDGX ERSTP); Releases 34-104756, 34-104758, 34-104759, and 34-104754.</p>

  <p><strong>Core move:</strong> After first changing EDGX ERSTP (Bulletin #18), Cboe applies the same <em>three-path</em> definition of <strong>Unique Identifier</strong> to all four of its U.S. equity books. Instead of a closed list of plumbing identifiers (MPID, Member ID, ERSTP/MTP Group, affiliate ID, Multiple Access ID), each exchange will now create a Unique Identifier at (i) the MPID level, (ii) the firm level, or (iii) wherever a User attests that STP/MTP is needed to prevent transactions that do <em>not</em> change beneficial ownership. Self-trade prevention is standardized around <strong>beneficial ownership</strong> rather than around individual pipes.</p>

  <h3>Mechanics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Same three-path rule text on all four books:</strong> EDGX and EDGA amend Rule 11.10(d) (ERSTP), while BYX and BZX amend Rule 11.9(f) (MTP). In each, a Unique Identifier may now be created at: (i) the MPID level; (ii) the firm level (Exchange Member / trading group); or (iii) <em>"where the User indicates that [ERSTP/MTP] is necessary in order to prevent transactions in securities in which there is no change in beneficial ownership"</em>, with an Exchange-provided attestation required for item (iii).</li>

    <li><strong>Retiring affiliate / Multiple Access labels, keeping their substance:</strong> All four filings delete the named <em>affiliate identifier</em> and <em>Multiple Access identifier</em> from the rule definitions. Instead, they state that the new item (iii) still <em>"continues to capture"</em> those concepts: Cboe staff will create cross-entity or cross-access-path IDs when a User represents that the flows are same-owner and should not cross.</li>

    <li><strong>Operational mechanics unchanged:</strong> ERSTP/MTP still only fires when both the incoming order and the resting opposite-side order carry an ERSTP/MTP modifier and the same Unique Identifier; the modifier on the incoming order continues to control the outcome (cancel incoming, cancel resting, cancel both, cancel smallest, or size-adjust). The change is strictly about <em>who can get which identifier where</em>, not about how the matching engine applies modifiers.</li>

    <li><strong>Common motivating scenarios:</strong> The EDGA, BYX, and BZX filings recycle EDGX’s examples: (1) two related trading desks that both access Cboe as Sponsored Participants but through <strong>different sponsoring brokers</strong> (different Sponsored Participant IDs), yet roll up to the same economic parent; and (2) a firm that mixes direct membership with multiple Sponsored Access paths (via different intermediaries) but wants a <strong>single</strong> self-trade perimeter across all those pipes. Under the old taxonomy, Cboe might need multiple affiliate/Multiple Access IDs or might be unable to issue one at all; under item (iii), it can create a single attested Unique Identifier.</li>

    <li><strong>Attestation and responsibility:</strong> None of the venues require an attestation for MPID-level or firm-level IDs, because those are already documented in membership and rulebook constructs. For beneficial-ownership IDs (item (iii)), however, Users must complete an Exchange attestation that the tool is being used to prevent <strong>no-change-in-beneficial-ownership</strong> trades. Each filing cites Exchange Act <strong>Section 9(a)(1)</strong> (wash sales) and <strong>FINRA Rules 6140(b) and 5210</strong> on self-trades and false prints, and emphasizes that ERSTP/MTP is optional and cannot replace User-managed supervisory and market-access risk controls.</li>

    <li><strong>Regulatory process and timing:</strong> EDGX, EDGA, BYX, and BZX all file these as <strong>Rule 19b&ndash;4(f)(6)</strong> <em>"non-controversial"</em> changes. In each case, the SEC <strong>waives the 30-day operative delay</strong> and allows the rule to become operative upon filing (January 28, 2026), with Cboe planning implementation during <strong>Q1 2026</strong> and announcing exact dates via Trade Desk Notices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Why this matters (structural view)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A cross-venue control plane keyed to beneficial ownership:</strong> With this cluster, Cboe defines a consistent notion of <em>"same actor"</em> for self-trade prevention across all its U.S. equity markets. The practical question for STP/MTP on EDGX/EDGA/BYX/BZX shifts from <em>"are these orders on the same pipe?"</em> to <em>"are these orders from the same beneficial owner?"</em>, as represented by the User in an attestation when Cboe has to bridge across pipes.</li>

    <li><strong>Global firms can centralize self-trade controls across brokers and time zones:</strong> Large multi-entity trading firms often fragment connectivity across multiple sponsoring brokers and jurisdictions. The new item (iii) path lets them ask Cboe to <strong>stitch those paths together</strong> into a single beneficial-ownership Unique Identifier that suppresses internal prints across EDGX, EDGA, BYX, and BZX, even when MPIDs and Sponsored Participant IDs differ.</li>

    <li><strong>Cleaner alignment between venue tools and wash-sale doctrine:</strong> By explicitly grounding the new Unique Identifier path in "no change in beneficial ownership" and citing Exchange Act and FINRA wash-sale / self-trade rules, Cboe aligns its optional tools with the underlying legal concepts. Firms can point to these identifiers as part of their wash-sale prevention program, while the SEC and FINRA can treat the attestation trail as evidence if firms misuse or under-scope their controls.</li>

    <li><strong>Higher signal-to-noise for surveillance:</strong> If firms broadly adopt beneficial-ownership Unique Identifiers, many unintentional self-trades that previously printed will now be blocked. That removes some <strong>innocent noise</strong> from the tape and Cboe’s own data. The self-trades that remain &mdash; where firms chose not to use STP/MTP or configured it narrowly &mdash; become structurally more noteworthy for exchange and regulator surveillance teams.</li>

    <li><strong>Standard-setting pressure on other U.S. equity venues:</strong> Because Cboe now offers the same beneficial-ownership-aware STP/MTP semantics on all four of its equities books, this cluster effectively sets a <strong>cross-venue standard</strong> for ownership-keyed self-trade prevention. Competing exchanges that limit STP strictly to MPID or simple member scopes may face pressure to introduce similar attested-beneficial-ownership constructs or explain why cross-broker self-trade prevention is not as flexible on their platforms.</li>
