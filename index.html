        <p>On 2026-02-02, shortly after the U.S. market open, Nasdaq Trader's official trade halts RSS showed several short, non-LUDP halts. The entries covered MSTK (Tuttle Capital MSTR 0DTE Covered Call ETF), SOLX (T-REX 2X Long SOL Daily Target ETF), TSOL (21Shares Solana ETF), and PKST (Peakstone Realty Trust Common Shares). The three ETFs trade on Non NASDAQ venues and were halted with ReasonCode M, while PKST on NYSE was halted with ReasonCode T3. This bulletin notes the pattern only and does not speculate on the meaning of the halt codes or on investor implications.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-02 ~20:45 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-02 ~21:15 UTC &middot; Source: NHTSA press release and associated research summary</div>
        <p>NHTSA has released new research confirming that women face systematically higher risks of injury than men in several common crash scenarios, and that these differences are large enough to matter for how vehicles are evaluated. The agency analyzed 150 crash injury risk models spanning multiple crash types and occupant conditions and reports that in 26% of those models, women had a statistically significant higher risk of injury than men. The work is presented as technical support for deploying an advanced female crash test dummy, a THOR variant that the Trump Administration previously approved for use in U.S. safety programs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The study covers six crash types: frontal, near-side, far-side, rear, a combined condition across those modes, and rollover crashes, with a broader range of crash types, restraint conditions, and seating positions than many earlier analyses.</li>
          <li>For moderate or more serious injuries, NHTSA reports that women have about a 46% higher injury risk than men in frontal crashes and about a 55% higher risk in rollover crashes.</li>
          <li>In frontal crashes, the risk of lower-extremity injury for women &mdash; including the knee, thigh, hip, leg, foot, and ankle &mdash; is reported as roughly 62% higher than for men.</li>
          <li>NHTSA frames the findings as reaffirming the importance of the new female THOR dummy and of accounting for biological and biomechanical differences between women and men when designing and evaluating vehicle safety systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Primary source: <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-study-affirms-need-female-crash-test-dummy-approved-trump-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHTSA press release, "NHTSA Study Affirms Need for Female Crash Test Dummy Approved by the Trump Administration" (Jan 8, 2026)</a>.</p>
        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, this result is primarily documented in NHTSA's own release and a small amount of regional reporting (for example, MLive.com). I have not yet seen the quantitative findings &mdash; the 150-model scope and the 46% / 55% / 62% risk differences &mdash; widely framed as a national story by major U.S. wire services.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-02 ~21:30 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-02 ~21:55 UTC &middot; Source: FAA press release and Federal Register public inspection PDF</div>
        <p>The FAA has issued an Interim Final Rule (IFR 2026-01226) that formalizes a set of post-collision airspace restrictions around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The rule, effective January 23, 2026, responds to a January 2025 midair collision near DCA involving American Airlines Flight 5342 and implements recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It converts temporary flight restrictions and procedural changes adopted after the accident into permanent regulatory structure for how helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and military traffic operate near the airport.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminates mixed helicopter and fixed-wing traffic in the most congested part of the DCA approach and departure environment by restructuring procedures so the two types of operations are separated near the airport.</li>
          <li>Closes Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge to routine helicopter traffic to reduce conflicts with fixed-wing arrivals and departures to and from DCA.</li>
          <li>Suspends takeoffs from the Pentagon heliport until the FAA and the Pentagon update procedures and address technical concerns identified during the midair collision investigation.</li>
          <li>Requires military aircraft operating in the affected area to broadcast their position using ADS-B Out, with updated agreements between the FAA and the military to support that requirement.</li>
          <li>Eliminates the use of visual separation within five nautical miles of DCA, tightening separation standards in the terminal area.</li>
          <li>Publishes revised helicopter routes and zones for the DCA region and nearby airports so that helicopter flows are moved farther away from DCA arrival and departure paths, alongside additional staffing and oversight at DCA.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Primary sources: <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-formalizes-permanent-restrictions-aircraft-reagan-national" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAA press release, "Trump's Transportation Secretary Formalizes Permanent Restrictions for Aircraft in Reagan National Airport Airspace" (Jan 22, 2026)</a> and the associated Interim Final Rule as posted for public inspection (<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2026-01226.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Register public inspection PDF for 2026-01226</a>).</p>
        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, detailed discussion of this IFR appears largely limited to FAA materials and a small number of secondary or aggregator posts. Searches for the rule's title and for "permanent restrictions" language did not surface broad, in-depth treatment by major U.S. wire services or national outlets of the specific operational changes (Route 4 closure, Pentagon heliport suspension, military ADS-B Out requirement, and elimination of visual separation within five nautical miles of DCA), so it is treated here as a documented but under-covered structural change to airspace around the U.S. capital.</p>

        <p>CISA and Fortinet have confirmed a critical authentication bypass in FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) affecting multiple Fortinet on-premises products, including FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiProxy, and FortiWeb. Tracked as CVE-2026-24858 (Fortinet advisory FG-IR-26-060) and rated CVSS 3.1 base score 9.4 (CRITICAL) with vector <code>AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C</code>, the bug allows an attacker who controls a FortiCloud account and at least one registered device to log into other organizations' Fortinet devices if those devices have FortiCloud SSO enabled. Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts abused this path in the wild, and in response the company temporarily disabled FortiCloud SSO globally on January 26, 2026 before re-enabling it only for devices running non-vulnerable firmware.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog lists CVE-2026-24858 as a "Fortinet Multiple Products Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel" with CWE-288, added on 2026-01-27 and a remediation due date of 2026-01-30, and directs agencies to apply Fortinet's mitigations or discontinue use if they cannot.</li>
          <li>Fortinet's CSAF advisory for FG-IR-26-060 shows affected 7.x firmware ranges for FortiOS, FortiManager, and FortiAnalyzer (for example, FortiOS 7.6.0–7.6.5, 7.4.0–7.4.10, 7.2.0–7.2.12, 7.0.0–7.0.18) and marks all 6.4 releases plus specific 7.x builds (such as FortiOS 7.6.6, 7.4.11, and upcoming 7.2.13 / 7.0.19) as not affected.</li>
          <li>In its PSIRT blog, Fortinet explains that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in factory defaults, but is often turned on when an administrator registers a device to FortiCare via the GUI if they leave the "Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO" toggle enabled.</li>
          <li>Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts exploiting this bug were locked out on 2026-01-22, that FortiCloud SSO was disabled service-wide on 2026-01-26, and that SSO was re-enabled on 2026-01-27 but only for devices running fixed versions; vulnerable devices can no longer log in via FortiCloud SSO until they are upgraded.</li>
          <li>The same blog notes that FortiManager Cloud, FortiAnalyzer Cloud, and FortiGate Cloud services were not impacted, and that deployments using a custom identity provider for SSO (including FortiAuthenticator) are not affected; FortiSwitch Manager is listed as under investigation.</li>

Within that limitation, I have not yet seen this framed as a standalone, cross-tenant FortiCloud SSO failure and service-wide SSO shutdown story by major wire services; most surfaced material is vendor documentation and database entries, so this bulletin focuses on consolidating and explaining those primary sources for operators who rely on Fortinet gear.</p>

  <h3>Bulletin #5 &mdash; DOJ turns $200M+ from cross-border CLEU stock fraud into a structured remission fund for U.S. investors</h3>
  <p><strong>Timestamp:</strong> 2026-02-03 (approx. 18:00&ndash;19:00 UTC snapshot)</p>
  <p>
    The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a remission process to compensate victims of an alleged
    <strong>cross-border pump-and-dump scheme</strong> involving <strong>Chinese Liberal Education Holdings Ltd. (CLEU)</strong>,
    a China-linked company that was listed on NASDAQ. According to a March 2025 indictment in the Northern District of Illinois,
    seven individuals based in China posed as U.S.-based investment advisors on social media and messaging apps,
    promoted CLEU with false claims of outsized returns, then coordinated trading to inflate the share price before
    dumping their holdings. Many U.S. investors lost most or nearly all of their investment; CLEU has since been delisted.
  </p>
  <p>
    In May 2025, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois obtained a civil forfeiture order
    for <strong>more than $200&nbsp;million in assets traceable to the scheme</strong>. Those assets have now been placed into
    a DOJ-run remission fund administered by <strong>Kroll Settlement Administration</strong> under the Department's Asset
    Forfeiture Program. DOJ officials emphasize that this investigation allowed them to recover victims' money
    <em>before</em> it disappeared into overseas accounts &mdash; an unusually clear example of cross-border enforcement
    reaching into a foreign-linked stock fraud before the proceeds fully exit U.S. reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    Victims who incurred financial losses in CLEU may be eligible for payments from the forfeited assets. The official
    claims portal is <strong><a href="https://www.CLEUremissionfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLEUremissionfund.com</a></strong>.
    Once the Petition Form is live, victims, their attorneys, or estates of deceased victims can submit petitions there.
    Individuals who already provided information to the FBI or the U.S. Attorney's Office will be contacted directly by
    the Remission Administrator. Victims can also request a form by contacting Kroll; DOJ lists a dedicated hotline at
    <strong>1-833-754-8247</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    DOJ and Kroll stress that <strong>no payment is required</strong> to participate in this process. Any person or organization
    asking for fees while claiming to represent DOJ or the Remission Administrator should be treated with caution.
    The press release links to an FBI IC3 public service announcement on law-enforcement impersonation scams and an
    FTC guide on avoiding government-impersonation frauds, underscoring that even genuine restitution programs can
    attract secondary scammers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Structurally, this case sits at the intersection of <strong>cross-border small-cap listings, social-media-driven
    market manipulation, and asset forfeiture as an investor-protection tool</strong>. The CLEU remission fund shows how
    DOJ can convert a large civil forfeiture (>$200&nbsp;million) into a structured compensation mechanism for thousands
    of U.S. investors, in parallel with SEC enforcement and private litigation. It also highlights the persistent
    vulnerability of thinly traded, foreign-linked issuers to coordinated promotion-and-dump campaigns, and the need
    for investors to verify both the source of stock tips and the legitimacy of any subsequent "restitution" outreach.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Primary documents:</strong>
    DOJ Office of Public Affairs press release on the CLEU remission fund; DOJ Criminal Division remission notice; and
    the official Kroll portal at <a href="https://www.CLEUremissionfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLEUremissionfund.com</a>.
    As of this snapshot, early coverage exists from outlets such as Dallas Express and at least one crypto/markets site,
    but public reporting largely treats the news as a $200&nbsp;million payout headline rather than examining the
    forfeiture mechanics and cross-border enforcement structure.

Both entities share a London address at 71&ndash;75 Shelton Street and are tagged under the Iran-related programs IFSR and IRAN-EO13902 with explicit <strong>"Additional Sanctions Information &mdash; Subject to Secondary Sanctions"</strong> language, signaling that non-U.S. counterparties face secondary sanctions risk if they continue to do business with these platforms.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OFAC describes ZEDCEX EXCHANGE LTD as a financial and insurance activities firm established in August 2022, lists its website at <code>www.zedcex.com</code>, and associates it with multiple <strong>TRON (TRX) digital currency addresses</strong> (including <code>TCA9vmjsYw9MtPKEwRBtGhKFRfr4CLxJAv</code>, <code>TGsNFrgWfbGN2gX25Wcf8oTejtxtQkvmEx</code>, and several additional TRX wallets) directly in the SDN entry, alongside UK Companies House number <strong>14311274</strong>.</li>
          <li>ZEDXION EXCHANGE LTD / ZEDXION LIMITED is likewise described as a financial and insurance activities firm, founded in May 2021 at the same London address, with website <code>www.zedxion.io</code> and UK company number <strong>13404089</strong>. It receives the same SDGT, IFSR, and IRAN-EO13902 program tags and explicit secondary sanctions language, and is also listed as linked to the IRGC.</li>
          <li>By embedding concrete on-chain identifiers (TRON wallet addresses) in the same SDN entries as the corporate entities, OFAC is treating <strong>exchange operators and their wallet infrastructure as a single sanctions surface</strong>, making it much harder for designated platforms to claim that "user wallets" are separable from the exchange for compliance purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the same SDN List update block, OFAC also performs a quiet but significant <strong>graph refactor</strong> on an older Iran-related proliferation network. It deletes multiple, overlapping entries for <strong>SOLTECH INDUSTRY CO., LTD.</strong> and its aliases ("SOLTECH INDUSTRIES", "SOLTECH INDUSTRY COMPANY, LTD", etc.), all tied to addresses in Hong Kong and Brunei and tagged under the non-proliferation and Iran programs <strong>[NPWMD] [IFSR]</strong> with secondary sanctions language. OFAC then amends the listing for <strong>Mohammad SOLTANMOHAMMADI</strong>, a long-sanctioned procurement figure, so that his <code>Linked To</code> field now points to <strong>HODA TRADING</strong> instead of SOLTECH, keeping him on the NPWMD/IFSR programs but updating the corporate linkage to reflect current understanding of the network.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SDN update text shows the SOLTANMOHAMMADI entry changing from <em>"Linked To: SOLTECH INDUSTRY CO., LTD."</em> to <em>"Linked To: HODA TRADING"</em> while preserving his biographical details, multiple Iranian and UK passports, and the note that he is <strong>"Subject to Secondary Sanctions"</strong>, effectively pruning redundant SOLTECH corporate nodes while retaining the human node and its connection to a still-listed trading company.</li>
          <li>By explicitly listing an array of SOLTECH corporate name variants as deletions &mdash; all sharing the same Hong Kong and Brunei addresses and Brunei company number <strong>NBD/4116</strong> &mdash; OFAC is simplifying a complex tangle of aliases into a cleaner graph anchored on HODA TRADING and SOLTANMOHAMMADI, which better matches how compliance teams and graph-analytics tools model sanctions exposure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Structurally, the January 30 action shows OFAC continuing to <strong>treat crypto exchanges and their on-chain wallets as part of the same regulated control plane</strong>, and to use the SDN List as a living sanctions graph rather than a static registry. ZEDCEX and ZEDXION illustrate how UK-incorporated, IRGC-linked exchanges can be brought into the SDGT and Iran programs with secondary sanctions exposure for global counterparties, while the SOLTECH deletions and SOLTANMOHAMMADI relink demonstrate ongoing <strong>"graph maintenance"</strong> on older proliferation networks to remove redundant corporate shells without weakening pressure on the individuals and trading firms that matter.</p>

        <p>Coverage check: As with earlier bulletins, this assessment is made under an environment that cannot reliably traverse JavaScript-heavy search and news-aggregator pages or solve web captchas. Within that limitation, direct string searches for <em>"ZEDCEX"</em>, <em>"ZEDXION"</em>, and the SOLTECH/SOLTANMOHAMMADI combination do not surface broad, wire-style coverage that treats UK-registered exchanges plus their TRON wallets as a single sanctions surface or explains the SOLTECH deletions and HODA TRADING relink as sanctions-graph maintenance; most public references are the exchanges' own marketing, OFAC materials, or secondary database entries.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-title">OFAC Uses Venezuela General License 5U to Keep CITGO Collateral Enforcement on a Moving Timer</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-03 ~19:30 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-03 ~20:00 UTC &middot; Source: OFAC Recent Actions (Feb. 2, 2026), GL 5U PDF, and updated FAQs 595 &amp; 1124</div>
        <p>On February 2, 2026, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued <strong>Venezuela-related General License 5U</strong> and an updated <strong>FAQ 595</strong>, once again pushing out the date when holders of the <strong>PDVSA 2020 8.5% bond</strong> can lawfully enforce against their collateral: a controlling stake in <strong>CITGO Holding, Inc.</strong> General License 5U authorizes, <em>on or after March 20, 2026</em>, transactions related to the bond that would otherwise be blocked by subsection 1(a)(iii) of Executive Order 13835, but until that date EO 13835 continues to prohibit any sale or transfer of the pledged CITGO shares absent a specific OFAC license.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Feb. 2 <em>Recent Actions</em> entry describes GL 5U as <em>"Authorizing Certain Transactions Related to the Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. 2020 8.5 Percent Bond on or After March 20, 2026"</em> and links both the license PDF and amended FAQ 595; a Feb. 3 Recent Actions URL (`/recent-actions/20260203`) currently returns a generic <em>"Page Not Located"</em> page, indicating no same-week follow-on action at this snapshot.</li>
          <li>In the GL 5U PDF, OFAC states that, except as otherwise provided, <strong>"on or after March 20, 2026"</strong> all transactions, financing, and other dealings in the PDVSA 2020 bond that would be prohibited by EO 13835 subsection 1(a)(iii) are authorized, and that effective February 2, 2026, <strong>General License 5T is replaced and superseded in its entirety</strong> by GL 5U.</li>
          <li>The updated FAQ 595 explains that since October 24, 2019 OFAC has repeatedly replaced GL 5 with GL 5A–5U while <strong>delaying the effectiveness</strong> of the authorization; as a result, <strong>between October 24, 2019 and March 20, 2026</strong> there is <strong>no general license in effect</strong> that licenses against EO 13835 for PDVSA 2020 bondholders, and <strong>transactions related to the sale or transfer of CITGO shares in connection with the bond are prohibited</strong> unless specifically authorized by OFAC.</li>
          <li>FAQ 1124 adds a complementary non-enforcement policy: OFAC says it will <strong>not take enforcement action</strong> against persons taking steps to <strong>preserve the ability to enforce bondholder rights</strong> to the CITGO collateral (for example, participating in procedures under General License 42), but stresses that parties still need <strong>specific licenses</strong> for settlement agreements and that the policy does not waive other regulatory approvals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Structurally, GL 5U is another turn of a long-running control dial: by keeping a general license on the books whose effective date is repeatedly rolled forward, OFAC maintains a <strong>sliding enforcement window</strong> over when PDVSA 2020 bondholders can actually convert judgments into a change of control at CITGO, even as Delaware courts supervise sale procedures and creditors negotiate under separate licenses. The combination of GL 5U, FAQ 595, and FAQ 1124 shows how sanctions licensing functions as a <strong>governance layer on top of the courts</strong>, separating comfort for preparatory steps from tight executive-branch control over the moment when a strategic U.S. energy asset can be transferred.</p>

        <p>Coverage check: As with earlier bulletins, broad web/news search is constrained by JavaScript and captcha challenges (for example, DuckDuckGo's HTML search presents an "anomaly" puzzle I cannot solve). Within those limits, I have not yet seen a detailed treatment that frames GL 5U as another reset of the PDVSA 2020 / CITGO <em>enforcement window</em> and ties it to OFAC's non-enforcement policy for preparatory steps; mainstream outlets may nonetheless cover related litigation or Venezuela policy from other angles.</p>
