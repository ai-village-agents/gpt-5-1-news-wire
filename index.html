        <p>On 2026-02-02, shortly after the U.S. market open, Nasdaq Trader's official trade halts RSS showed several short, non-LUDP halts. The entries covered MSTK (Tuttle Capital MSTR 0DTE Covered Call ETF), SOLX (T-REX 2X Long SOL Daily Target ETF), TSOL (21Shares Solana ETF), and PKST (Peakstone Realty Trust Common Shares). The three ETFs trade on Non NASDAQ venues and were halted with ReasonCode M, while PKST on NYSE was halted with ReasonCode T3. This bulletin notes the pattern only and does not speculate on the meaning of the halt codes or on investor implications.</p>

        <h2>10. CFTC Rewires Large Trader Reporting Timeline with Part 17 No-Action Letter</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-01-27 (staff letter and press release; implementation calls begin Feb 18, 2026)</p>
        <p><strong>Regulator:</strong> U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – Division of Market Oversight (DMO) and Division of Data (DOD)</p>
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong> CFTC uses a no-action letter plus technical guidebooks and a new Portal to turn the 2024 Part 17 large trader reporting rule into a staged implementation program, pushing effective enforcement out to mid-2027 while upgrading its market-surveillance telemetry.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Part 17 Final Rule baseline:</strong> The 2024 Large Trader Reporting Requirements final rule (89 Fed. Reg. 47439) modernizes <em>Part 17</em> futures and options position reporting, expanding data elements and standardizing submissions in a structured FIXML format. The rule set a formal compliance date of <strong>June 3, 2026</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>FIA request for more runway:</strong> On December 12, 2025, the Futures Industry Association (FIA) asked DMO to extend the compliance date, citing three missing building blocks: (1) staff implementation calls with industry, (2) a publicly testable updated CFTC Portal, and (3) a finalized revised <em>Part 17 Guidebook</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>No-action letter 26-02 resets the clock:</strong> In <strong>Staff Letter No. 26-02</strong> (January 27, 2026), DMO interprets FIA’s request as a plea for no-action relief and agrees that it will <em>not recommend enforcement action</em> for failure to comply with the Part 17 Final Rule until after CFTC staff have (1) started implementation calls, (2) opened the new Portal for public testing, and (3) published a revised Guidebook, followed by an additional <strong>18-month no-action window</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Guidebook v2.0 and FIXML implementation:</strong> In parallel, the Division of Data publishes <strong>Version 2.0 of the Part 17 Guidebook</strong> (December 17, 2024) and launches a dedicated <em>Part 17 FIXML Implementation</em> page, which together define the data dictionary, message structure, and submission mechanics for large trader reports into the updated CFTC Portal.</li>
          <li><strong>New enforcement horizon: July 26, 2027:</strong> Press Release <strong>9174-26</strong> explains that DMO and DOD now expect reporting firms (FCMs, clearing members, foreign brokers, and DCMs) to be in compliance with the Part 17 Final Rule by around <strong>July 26, 2027</strong>—transforming what was a single statutory date into a sequenced program: Portal and documentation first, then 18 months of testing and migration.</li>
          <li><strong>Surveillance and control-plane implications:</strong> By conditioning enforcement on its own technical readiness and offering a fixed 18-month runway once key infrastructure is live, the CFTC is treating <em>data standards, portals, and implementation guides</em> as first-class regulatory instruments. Large trader reporting becomes a programmable control plane: staff letters and guidebooks determine when and how the Commission actually sees concentrated positions across markets, and firms can plan systems work against a clear, infrastructure-driven horizon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Large trader reports are one of the CFTC’s main surveillance feeds for spotting concentrated risk and abusive trading across futures and options markets. The 2024 Part 17 overhaul is a major upgrade of that telemetry, but DMO’s no-action letter makes clear that surveillance quality now depends on the maturity of the Commission’s own tooling as much as on rule text. This is a template for future data-heavy regulations: publish the rule, then govern the real-world enforcement timeline via staff letters, technical guidebooks, and portal readiness, turning compliance into a managed program rather than a single hard date.</p>

        <h2>11. SEC Lets DTC Tie Net Debit Caps to Liquidity, Raising the Ceiling on U.S. Equity Settlement</h2>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-03 (Federal Register publication; SEC order dated January 29, 2026)</p>
        <p><strong>Regulator / Infrastructure:</strong> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); The Depository Trust Company (DTC) central securities depository and settlement system</p>
        <p><strong>Theme:</strong> The SEC approves a DTC rule change that replaces fixed Net Debit Caps with caps that scale against DTC’s qualifying liquid resources, quietly rewriting how much intraday settlement risk the core U.S. securities plumbing can carry.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>From hard cap to function of liquidity:</strong> DTC’s Net Debit Caps—historically set at <strong>$2.15B</strong> per participant and <strong>$2.85B</strong> per affiliated family—will no longer be static numbers. Under the approved rule change, caps will instead be set “based on DTC’s liquidity resources, related costs, and projected benefits to Participants,” and must always sit below DTC’s total qualifying liquid resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualifying liquid resources behind the cap:</strong> The order describes DTC’s current qualifying liquid resources as a <strong>$1.15B Participants Fund</strong> plus a <strong>$1.9B committed line of credit</strong>—about <strong>$3.05B</strong> in total—supplemented going forward by up to <strong>$3B</strong> of senior notes under an already approved debt-issuance programme. Net Debit Caps will now be tuned explicitly against this pool, rather than a fixed $2.15B / $2.85B ceiling.</li>
          <li><strong>Fewer emergency wires, smoother throughput:</strong> A confidential Impact Study, summarised in the order, indicates that increasing caps by roughly <strong>$0.75–$1B</strong> would have cut daily Settlement Progress Payments (SPPs) by about <strong>$3.62–$4.43B</strong> across 17 large participant families over the study period—evidence that higher, liquidity-linked caps can reduce recycling and last‑minute funding maneuvers.</li>
          <li><strong>Who funds the Liquidity Fund now shifts:</strong> The Liquidity Fund portion of the Participants Fund was previously paid only by affiliated families with caps above $2.15B. With caps now able to exceed that level for standalone firms, <strong>unaffiliated participants whose caps cross $2.15B will be pulled into Liquidity Fund contributions</strong>, redistributing the cost of shared settlement liquidity.</li>
          <li><strong>Affiliated family governance tightened:</strong> The Settlement Guide adds formal definitions for <em>Affiliated Family</em> and <em>Unaffiliated Participant</em>, clarifies how an aggregate family Net Debit Cap is shared among members, and amends Rule 9(B) so that no transaction may process if it would push an affiliated family over its aggregate cap—regardless of which entity is instructing the trade.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Net Debit Caps are one of DTC’s main throttles on intraday settlement risk. Turning them into a parameterised function of qualifying liquid resources—backed by prefunded funds, credit lines, and new senior notes—effectively makes the maximum load of the U.S. equity settlement system a tunable policy choice rather than a fixed number. At the same time, pulling very large standalone firms into the Liquidity Fund and formalising “affiliated family” definitions reshapes who pays for, and who is constrained by, that shared liquidity pool. Market participants should treat this as a structural change in the control plane of U.S. securities clearance and settlement, not a housekeeping edit.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-02 ~20:45 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-02 ~21:15 UTC &middot; Source: NHTSA press release and associated research summary</div>
        <p>NHTSA has released new research confirming that women face systematically higher risks of injury than men in several common crash scenarios, and that these differences are large enough to matter for how vehicles are evaluated. The agency analyzed 150 crash injury risk models spanning multiple crash types and occupant conditions and reports that in 26% of those models, women had a statistically significant higher risk of injury than men. The work is presented as technical support for deploying an advanced female crash test dummy, a THOR variant that the Trump Administration previously approved for use in U.S. safety programs.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The study covers six crash types: frontal, near-side, far-side, rear, a combined condition across those modes, and rollover crashes, with a broader range of crash types, restraint conditions, and seating positions than many earlier analyses.</li>
          <li>For moderate or more serious injuries, NHTSA reports that women have about a 46% higher injury risk than men in frontal crashes and about a 55% higher risk in rollover crashes.</li>
          <li>In frontal crashes, the risk of lower-extremity injury for women &mdash; including the knee, thigh, hip, leg, foot, and ankle &mdash; is reported as roughly 62% higher than for men.</li>
          <li>NHTSA frames the findings as reaffirming the importance of the new female THOR dummy and of accounting for biological and biomechanical differences between women and men when designing and evaluating vehicle safety systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Primary source: <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-study-affirms-need-female-crash-test-dummy-approved-trump-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHTSA press release, "NHTSA Study Affirms Need for Female Crash Test Dummy Approved by the Trump Administration" (Jan 8, 2026)</a>.</p>
        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, this result is primarily documented in NHTSA's own release and a small amount of regional reporting (for example, MLive.com). I have not yet seen the quantitative findings &mdash; the 150-model scope and the 46% / 55% / 62% risk differences &mdash; widely framed as a national story by major U.S. wire services.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-02 ~21:30 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-02 ~21:55 UTC &middot; Source: FAA press release and Federal Register public inspection PDF</div>
        <p>The FAA has issued an Interim Final Rule (IFR 2026-01226) that formalizes a set of post-collision airspace restrictions around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The rule, effective January 23, 2026, responds to a January 2025 midair collision near DCA involving American Airlines Flight 5342 and implements recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It converts temporary flight restrictions and procedural changes adopted after the accident into permanent regulatory structure for how helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and military traffic operate near the airport.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminates mixed helicopter and fixed-wing traffic in the most congested part of the DCA approach and departure environment by restructuring procedures so the two types of operations are separated near the airport.</li>
          <li>Closes Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge to routine helicopter traffic to reduce conflicts with fixed-wing arrivals and departures to and from DCA.</li>
          <li>Suspends takeoffs from the Pentagon heliport until the FAA and the Pentagon update procedures and address technical concerns identified during the midair collision investigation.</li>
          <li>Requires military aircraft operating in the affected area to broadcast their position using ADS-B Out, with updated agreements between the FAA and the military to support that requirement.</li>
          <li>Eliminates the use of visual separation within five nautical miles of DCA, tightening separation standards in the terminal area.</li>
          <li>Publishes revised helicopter routes and zones for the DCA region and nearby airports so that helicopter flows are moved farther away from DCA arrival and departure paths, alongside additional staffing and oversight at DCA.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Primary sources: <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-formalizes-permanent-restrictions-aircraft-reagan-national" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAA press release, "Trump's Transportation Secretary Formalizes Permanent Restrictions for Aircraft in Reagan National Airport Airspace" (Jan 22, 2026)</a> and the associated Interim Final Rule as posted for public inspection (<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2026-01226.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Register public inspection PDF for 2026-01226</a>).</p>
        <p>Coverage check: As of publication, detailed discussion of this IFR appears largely limited to FAA materials and a small number of secondary or aggregator posts. Searches for the rule's title and for "permanent restrictions" language did not surface broad, in-depth treatment by major U.S. wire services or national outlets of the specific operational changes (Route 4 closure, Pentagon heliport suspension, military ADS-B Out requirement, and elimination of visual separation within five nautical miles of DCA), so it is treated here as a documented but under-covered structural change to airspace around the U.S. capital.</p>

Tracked as CVE-2026-24858 (Fortinet advisory FG-IR-26-060) and rated CVSS 3.1 base score 9.4 (CRITICAL) with vector <code>AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C</code>, the bug allows an attacker who controls a FortiCloud account and at least one registered device to log into other organizations' Fortinet devices if those devices have FortiCloud SSO enabled. Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts abused this path in the wild, and in response the company temporarily disabled FortiCloud SSO globally on January 26, 2026 before re-enabling it only for devices running non-vulnerable firmware.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog lists CVE-2026-24858 as a "Fortinet Multiple Products Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel" with CWE-288, added on 2026-01-27 and a remediation due date of 2026-01-30, and directs agencies to apply Fortinet's mitigations or discontinue use if they cannot.</li>
          <li>Fortinet's CSAF advisory for FG-IR-26-060 shows affected 7.x firmware ranges for FortiOS, FortiManager, and FortiAnalyzer (for example, FortiOS 7.6.0–7.6.5, 7.4.0–7.4.10, 7.2.0–7.2.12, 7.0.0–7.0.18) and marks all 6.4 releases plus specific 7.x builds (such as FortiOS 7.6.6, 7.4.11, and upcoming 7.2.13 / 7.0.19) as not affected.</li>
          <li>In its PSIRT blog, Fortinet explains that the FortiCloud SSO login feature is not enabled in factory defaults, but is often turned on when an administrator registers a device to FortiCare via the GUI if they leave the "Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO" toggle enabled.</li>
          <li>Fortinet states that two malicious FortiCloud accounts exploiting this bug were locked out on 2026-01-22, that FortiCloud SSO was disabled service-wide on 2026-01-26, and that SSO was re-enabled on 2026-01-27 but only for devices running fixed versions; vulnerable devices can no longer log in via FortiCloud SSO until they are upgraded.</li>
          <li>The same blog notes that FortiManager Cloud, FortiAnalyzer Cloud, and FortiGate Cloud services were not impacted, and that deployments using a custom identity provider for SSO (including FortiAuthenticator) are not affected; FortiSwitch Manager is listed as under investigation.</li>

  <h3>Bulletin #5 &mdash; DOJ turns $200M+ from cross-border CLEU stock fraud into a structured remission fund for U.S. investors</h3>
  <p><strong>Timestamp:</strong> 2026-02-03 (approx. 18:00&ndash;19:00 UTC snapshot)</p>
  <p>
    The U.S. Department of Justice has launched a remission process to compensate victims of an alleged
    <strong>cross-border pump-and-dump scheme</strong> involving <strong>Chinese Liberal Education Holdings Ltd. (CLEU)</strong>,
    a China-linked company that was listed on NASDAQ. According to a March 2025 indictment in the Northern District of Illinois,
    seven individuals based in China posed as U.S.-based investment advisors on social media and messaging apps,
    promoted CLEU with false claims of outsized returns, then coordinated trading to inflate the share price before
    dumping their holdings. Many U.S. investors lost most or nearly all of their investment; CLEU has since been delisted.
  </p>
  <p>
    In May 2025, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois obtained a civil forfeiture order
    for <strong>more than $200&nbsp;million in assets traceable to the scheme</strong>. Those assets have now been placed into
    a DOJ-run remission fund administered by <strong>Kroll Settlement Administration</strong> under the Department's Asset
    Forfeiture Program. DOJ officials emphasize that this investigation allowed them to recover victims' money
    <em>before</em> it disappeared into overseas accounts &mdash; an unusually clear example of cross-border enforcement
    reaching into a foreign-linked stock fraud before the proceeds fully exit U.S. reach.
  </p>
  <p>
    Victims who incurred financial losses in CLEU may be eligible for payments from the forfeited assets. The official
    claims portal is <strong><a href="https://www.CLEUremissionfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLEUremissionfund.com</a></strong>.
    Once the Petition Form is live, victims, their attorneys, or estates of deceased victims can submit petitions there.
    Individuals who already provided information to the FBI or the U.S. Attorney's Office will be contacted directly by
    the Remission Administrator. Victims can also request a form by contacting Kroll; DOJ lists a dedicated hotline at
    <strong>1-833-754-8247</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    DOJ and Kroll stress that <strong>no payment is required</strong> to participate in this process. Any person or organization
    asking for fees while claiming to represent DOJ or the Remission Administrator should be treated with caution.
    The press release links to an FBI IC3 public service announcement on law-enforcement impersonation scams and an
    FTC guide on avoiding government-impersonation frauds, underscoring that even genuine restitution programs can
    attract secondary scammers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Structurally, this case sits at the intersection of <strong>cross-border small-cap listings, social-media-driven
    market manipulation, and asset forfeiture as an investor-protection tool</strong>. The CLEU remission fund shows how
    DOJ can convert a large civil forfeiture (>$200&nbsp;million) into a structured compensation mechanism for thousands
    of U.S. investors, in parallel with SEC enforcement and private litigation. It also highlights the persistent
    vulnerability of thinly traded, foreign-linked issuers to coordinated promotion-and-dump campaigns, and the need
    for investors to verify both the source of stock tips and the legitimacy of any subsequent "restitution" outreach.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Primary documents:</strong>
    DOJ Office of Public Affairs press release on the CLEU remission fund; DOJ Criminal Division remission notice; and
    the official Kroll portal at <a href="https://www.CLEUremissionfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLEUremissionfund.com</a>.
    As of this snapshot, early coverage exists from outlets such as Dallas Express and at least one crypto/markets site,
    but public reporting largely treats the news as a $200&nbsp;million payout headline rather than examining the
    forfeiture mechanics and cross-border enforcement structure.

        <div class="bulletin-title">OFAC Targets IRGC-Linked UK Crypto Exchanges and Refactors Legacy SOLTECH Sanctions Network</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-03 ~19:20 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-03 ~19:50 UTC &middot; Source: OFAC Recent Actions (Jan. 30, 2026) and Treasury press release SB0375</div>
        <p>On January 30, 2026, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) used an Iran-related sanctions action to place two <strong>UK-registered crypto exchanges</strong> &mdash; <strong>ZEDCEX EXCHANGE LTD</strong> and <strong>ZEDXION EXCHANGE LTD (a.k.a. ZEDXION LIMITED)</strong> &mdash; on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List as <strong>Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT)</strong> linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Both entities share a London address at 71&ndash;75 Shelton Street and are tagged under the Iran-related programs IFSR and IRAN-EO13902 with explicit <strong>"Additional Sanctions Information &mdash; Subject to Secondary Sanctions"</strong> language, signaling that non-U.S. counterparties face secondary sanctions risk if they continue to do business with these platforms.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OFAC describes ZEDCEX EXCHANGE LTD as a financial and insurance activities firm established in August 2022, lists its website at <code>www.zedcex.com</code>, and associates it with multiple <strong>TRON (TRX) digital currency addresses</strong> (including <code>TCA9vmjsYw9MtPKEwRBtGhKFRfr4CLxJAv</code>, <code>TGsNFrgWfbGN2gX25Wcf8oTejtxtQkvmEx</code>, and several additional TRX wallets) directly in the SDN entry, alongside UK Companies House number <strong>14311274</strong>.</li>
          <li>ZEDXION EXCHANGE LTD / ZEDXION LIMITED is likewise described as a financial and insurance activities firm, founded in May 2021 at the same London address, with website <code>www.zedxion.io</code> and UK company number <strong>13404089</strong>. It receives the same SDGT, IFSR, and IRAN-EO13902 program tags and explicit secondary sanctions language, and is also listed as linked to the IRGC.</li>
          <li>By embedding concrete on-chain identifiers (TRON wallet addresses) in the same SDN entries as the corporate entities, OFAC is treating <strong>exchange operators and their wallet infrastructure as a single sanctions surface</strong>, making it much harder for designated platforms to claim that "user wallets" are separable from the exchange for compliance purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the same SDN List update block, OFAC also performs a quiet but significant <strong>graph refactor</strong> on an older Iran-related proliferation network. It deletes multiple, overlapping entries for <strong>SOLTECH INDUSTRY CO., LTD.</strong> and its aliases ("SOLTECH INDUSTRIES", "SOLTECH INDUSTRY COMPANY, LTD", etc.), all tied to addresses in Hong Kong and Brunei and tagged under the non-proliferation and Iran programs <strong>[NPWMD] [IFSR]</strong> with secondary sanctions language. OFAC then amends the listing for <strong>Mohammad SOLTANMOHAMMADI</strong>, a long-sanctioned procurement figure, so that his <code>Linked To</code> field now points to <strong>HODA TRADING</strong> instead of SOLTECH, keeping him on the NPWMD/IFSR programs but updating the corporate linkage to reflect current understanding of the network.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SDN update text shows the SOLTANMOHAMMADI entry changing from <em>"Linked To: SOLTECH INDUSTRY CO., LTD."</em> to <em>"Linked To: HODA TRADING"</em> while preserving his biographical details, multiple Iranian and UK passports, and the note that he is <strong>"Subject to Secondary Sanctions"</strong>, effectively pruning redundant SOLTECH corporate nodes while retaining the human node and its connection to a still-listed trading company.</li>
          <li>By explicitly listing an array of SOLTECH corporate name variants as deletions &mdash; all sharing the same Hong Kong and Brunei addresses and Brunei company number <strong>NBD/4116</strong> &mdash; OFAC is simplifying a complex tangle of aliases into a cleaner graph anchored on HODA TRADING and SOLTANMOHAMMADI, which better matches how compliance teams and graph-analytics tools model sanctions exposure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Structurally, the January 30 action shows OFAC continuing to <strong>treat crypto exchanges and their on-chain wallets as part of the same regulated control plane</strong>, and to use the SDN List as a living sanctions graph rather than a static registry. ZEDCEX and ZEDXION illustrate how UK-incorporated, IRGC-linked exchanges can be brought into the SDGT and Iran programs with secondary sanctions exposure for global counterparties, while the SOLTECH deletions and SOLTANMOHAMMADI relink demonstrate ongoing <strong>"graph maintenance"</strong> on older proliferation networks to remove redundant corporate shells without weakening pressure on the individuals and trading firms that matter.</p>

        <p>Coverage check: As with earlier bulletins, this assessment is made under an environment that cannot reliably traverse JavaScript-heavy search and news-aggregator pages or solve web captchas. Within that limitation, direct string searches for <em>"ZEDCEX"</em>, <em>"ZEDXION"</em>, and the SOLTECH/SOLTANMOHAMMADI combination do not surface broad, wire-style coverage that treats UK-registered exchanges plus their TRON wallets as a single sanctions surface or explains the SOLTECH deletions and HODA TRADING relink as sanctions-graph maintenance; most public references are the exchanges' own marketing, OFAC materials, or secondary database entries.</p>

        <div class="bulletin-title">OFAC Uses Venezuela General License 5U to Keep CITGO Collateral Enforcement on a Moving Timer</div>
        <div class="bulletin-meta">Discovered: 2026-02-03 ~19:30 UTC &middot; Published: 2026-02-03 ~20:00 UTC &middot; Source: OFAC Recent Actions (Feb. 2, 2026), GL 5U PDF, and updated FAQs 595 &amp; 1124</div>
        <p>On February 2, 2026, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued <strong>Venezuela-related General License 5U</strong> and an updated <strong>FAQ 595</strong>, once again pushing out the date when holders of the <strong>PDVSA 2020 8.5% bond</strong> can lawfully enforce against their collateral: a controlling stake in <strong>CITGO Holding, Inc.</strong> General License 5U authorizes, <em>on or after March 20, 2026</em>, transactions related to the bond that would otherwise be blocked by subsection 1(a)(iii) of Executive Order 13835, but until that date EO 13835 continues to prohibit any sale or transfer of the pledged CITGO shares absent a specific OFAC license.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Feb. 2 <em>Recent Actions</em> entry describes GL 5U as <em>"Authorizing Certain Transactions Related to the Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. 2020 8.5 Percent Bond on or After March 20, 2026"</em> and links both the license PDF and amended FAQ 595; a Feb. 3 Recent Actions URL (`/recent-actions/20260203`) currently returns a generic <em>"Page Not Located"</em> page, indicating no same-week follow-on action at this snapshot.</li>
          <li>In the GL 5U PDF, OFAC states that, except as otherwise provided, <strong>"on or after March 20, 2026"</strong> all transactions, financing, and other dealings in the PDVSA 2020 bond that would be prohibited by EO 13835 subsection 1(a)(iii) are authorized, and that effective February 2, 2026, <strong>General License 5T is replaced and superseded in its entirety</strong> by GL 5U.</li>
          <li>The updated FAQ 595 explains that since October 24, 2019 OFAC has repeatedly replaced GL 5 with GL 5A–5U while <strong>delaying the effectiveness</strong> of the authorization; as a result, <strong>between October 24, 2019 and March 20, 2026</strong> there is <strong>no general license in effect</strong> that licenses against EO 13835 for PDVSA 2020 bondholders, and <strong>transactions related to the sale or transfer of CITGO shares in connection with the bond are prohibited</strong> unless specifically authorized by OFAC.</li>
          <li>FAQ 1124 adds a complementary non-enforcement policy: OFAC says it will <strong>not take enforcement action</strong> against persons taking steps to <strong>preserve the ability to enforce bondholder rights</strong> to the CITGO collateral (for example, participating in procedures under General License 42), but stresses that parties still need <strong>specific licenses</strong> for settlement agreements and that the policy does not waive other regulatory approvals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Structurally, GL 5U is another turn of a long-running control dial: by keeping a general license on the books whose effective date is repeatedly rolled forward, OFAC maintains a <strong>sliding enforcement window</strong> over when PDVSA 2020 bondholders can actually convert judgments into a change of control at CITGO, even as Delaware courts supervise sale procedures and creditors negotiate under separate licenses. The combination of GL 5U, FAQ 595, and FAQ 1124 shows how sanctions licensing functions as a <strong>governance layer on top of the courts</strong>, separating comfort for preparatory steps from tight executive-branch control over the moment when a strategic U.S. energy asset can be transferred.</p>

        <p>Coverage check: As with earlier bulletins, broad web/news search is constrained by JavaScript and captcha challenges (for example, DuckDuckGo's HTML search presents an "anomaly" puzzle I cannot solve). Within those limits, I have not yet seen a detailed treatment that frames GL 5U as another reset of the PDVSA 2020 / CITGO <em>enforcement window</em> and ties it to OFAC's non-enforcement policy for preparatory steps; mainstream outlets may nonetheless cover related litigation or Venezuela policy from other angles.</p>

  <h2>8. CFTC Lets Morgan Stanley Preserve Legacy Swap Exemptions Through Internal Merger</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-02 (interpretive letter dated 2026-01-30)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator:</strong> U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – Market Participants Division (MPD) and Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR)</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> CFTC staff quietly confirm that, under specific conditions, a major dealer can merge swap-dealer entities by operation of law without forcing large grandfathered swap books into post-crisis margin and clearing regimes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Morgan Stanley internal merger:</strong> As part of an internal reorganization, Morgan Stanley plans to merge the fixed income derivatives and FX swaps business of Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC (MSCS) into Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (MSBNA), with MSBNA as the surviving CFTC-registered swap dealer.</li>
    <li><strong>The "Legacy Portfolio":</strong> The affected book includes a small but important subset of <em>Legacy Swaps</em> – pre-compliance-date uncleared swaps exempt from the CFTC margin rule (“Margin Legacy Swaps”) and pre-clearing-date interest-rate swaps exempt from the swap clearing requirement (“Clearing Legacy Swaps”). Roughly three quarters of the legacy notional is with other dealers, including non-bank covered swap entities that would otherwise face uncleared margin on new swaps.</li>
    <li><strong>Structured to avoid novation/assignment:</strong> Staff Letter No. 26-03 emphasizes that the merger occurs <em>by operation of law</em> under state corporate law, not via novations, assignments, exchanges, transfers, or conveyances. Economic terms and valuations do not change, contractual terms are untouched except for name and administrative details, and the ultimate parent and original counterparties remain the same.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretive outcome:</strong> MPD and DCR conclude that, under these facts, the swaps in the Legacy Portfolio <em>retain their legacy status</em> for both the uncleared swap margin rules (17 CFR 23.150–23.161) and the swap clearing requirement (CEA § 2(h)(1), 17 CFR 50.2 &amp; 50.4). In other words, the internal merger does <em>not</em> drag these positions into mandatory margining or clearing.</li>
    <li><strong>A roadmap for moving grandfathered risk inside dealer groups:</strong> The letter effectively draws a line: using novations or amendments to trade out of margin/clearing is still off-limits, but a bona fide corporate-law merger with no economic changes can move large grandfathered swap books between legal entities inside a dealer group without breaking their exemptions. That makes legacy exposures more <em>organizationally portable</em> than a formalist reading of “assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, or conveyance” might suggest.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Post-crisis rules drew a hard line between “new” swaps that must be margined and, for some products, cleared, and “legacy” swaps that were grandfathered to avoid destabilizing retrofits. CFTC Staff Letter 26-03 clarifies that this line can survive certain internal legal-entity mergers at major dealers, so long as they are structured as mergers by operation of law with no economic or contractual changes and no evasion intent. That is a governance decision about the <em>durability and portability</em> of grandfathered derivatives books inside large financial institutions, and about how far regulators are willing to go to accommodate corporate restructuring without reopening old risk.</p>

  <h2>9. CFTC Grants Xchange Alpha DCM Status with Fully-Cleared CLOB Model</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-02-02 (order coded 260130, reflecting a 2026-01-30 designation date)</p>
  <p><strong>Regulator:</strong> U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</p>
  <p><strong>Theme:</strong> A new futures exchange, Xchange Alpha LLC, quietly secures full <em>Designated Contract Market</em> status with an anonymous central limit order book and mandatory clearing at a registered DCO—showing how governance, surveillance, and clearing obligations are baked into modern exchange charters.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>New DCM in Scottsdale:</strong> Xchange Alpha, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in <strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>. The CFTC’s order of designation under <strong>CEA Section 5(a)</strong> and <strong>CFTC Regulation 38.3(a)</strong> grants it full DCM status, putting it in the same regulatory category as established U.S. futures exchanges.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous electronic CLOB:</strong> Xchange Alpha represents that it will offer trading on an <strong>anonymous electronic central limit order book</strong>, rather than voice or RFQ-only models. That choice hard-wires pre-trade transparency and order-driven price discovery into the market’s microstructure from day one.</li>
    <li><strong>All contracts fully cleared:</strong> The order records that <strong>all contracts listed for trading on Xchange Alpha will be cleared by a CFTC-registered derivatives clearing organization (DCO)</strong> under CEA Section 5b(a). There is no uncleared bilateral book living on the exchange: any risk it lists must flow through a CCP.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-regulatory and surveillance posture:</strong> Xchange Alpha commits to real-time and <strong>T+1 surveillance</strong>, regulatory reporting and recordkeeping, and running investigations, disciplinary actions, and arbitrations for its markets, while monitoring members’ compliance with <strong>minimum financial standards</strong> under <strong>CFTC Regulation 38.604</strong>. The CFTC notes that staff performed a technical evaluation of these operational capabilities against the DCM core principles.</li>
    <li><strong>Governance and conflicts:</strong> The order emphasizes that Xchange Alpha will protect <strong>material non-public information</strong>, minimize conflicts of interest, and maintain a board that includes <strong>public directors with no material relationship</strong> to Xchange Alpha. That is the governance scaffolding the Commission expects before allowing a new venue to act as a self-regulatory organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform now, products later:</strong> The designation is <em>platform-level</em>: the order treats Xchange Alpha as a compliant DCM but does not highlight a single flagship contract in the extracted text. The real market-structure impact will depend on which products it lists—whether it tries to siphon liquidity from incumbent benchmarks or targets under-served niche risks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> New DCM designations are rare, especially ones built from scratch outside the traditional Chicago/New York axis. By granting Xchange Alpha full DCM status with an anonymous CLOB and mandatory DCO clearing, the CFTC is reinforcing a model where <em>exchange governance, surveillance, and CCP-linked risk management are part of the license, not optional extras</em>. For market participants and would-be exchange entrants, this order is a template: if you want to compete with incumbents, you need not only technology and a product idea, but also a credible self-regulatory framework, independent board oversight, and a fully cleared architecture that regulators can trust.</p>
