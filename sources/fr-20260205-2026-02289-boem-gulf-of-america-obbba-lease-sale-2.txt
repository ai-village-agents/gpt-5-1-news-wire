II. Statutes and Regulations

    Each lease is issued pursuant to the OBBBA and OCSLA, 43 U.S.C. 
1331 et seq., as amended, and is subject to OCSLA implementing 
regulations promulgated pursuant thereto in 30 CFR part 556, and other 
applicable statutes and regulations in existence upon the effective 
date of the lease, as well as those applicable statutes enacted and 
regulations promulgated thereafter, except to the extent that the 
after-enacted statutes and regulations explicitly conflict with an 
express provision of the lease. Each lease is subject to amendments to 
statutes and regulations, including but not limited to OCSLA, that do 
not explicitly conflict with an express provision of the lease. The 
lessee expressly bears the risk that such new or amended statutes and 
regulations (i.e., those that do not explicitly conflict with an 
express provision of the lease) may increase or decrease the lessee's 
obligations under the lease. BOEM reserves the right to

[[Page 5253]]

reject any and all bids received, regardless of the amount offered (see 
30 CFR 556.516).
    The OBBBA was signed into law on July 4, 2025, and contains 
statutory requirements to conduct lease sales in the Gulf of America 
with specific parameters and timing requirements. Section 50102(a)(1) 
of the OBBBA requires the Secretary to conduct a minimum of 30 offshore 
lease sales in the Gulf of America Region through 2040, notwithstanding 
the 2024-2029 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program (or 
any successor leasing program that does not satisfy the requirements of 
the OBBBA). This lease sale constitutes the second lease sale required 
by OBBBA in the Gulf of America. The statute directs the Secretary to 
hold at least two lease sales in each calendar year from 2026 through 
2039 (by March 15 and August 15 of each applicable year), and at least 
one sale by March 15, 2040. The statute further requires specific Terms 
and Stipulations that must be used for these sales, stating that the 
Secretary must ``offer the same lease form, lease terms, economic 
conditions, and stipulations 4 through 9 as contained in the Final 
Notice of Sale of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management entitled for 
the `Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf Region-Wide Oil and Gas 
Lease Sale 254' (85 FR 8010 (February 12, 2020)).''
    Additionally, the OBBBA requires the Secretary to set royalty rates 
at not less than 12\1/2\ percent and not more than 16\2/3\ percent; 
establishes a 10-year primary term for deepwater GOA leases; requires 
not fewer than 80 million acres to be offered, or all available 
unleased acres if less than 80 million acres are available; and 
increases the amount of revenue sharing pursuant to the Gulf of Mexico 
Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA, Pub. L. 109-432) from $500 million 
to $650 million through 2034. The annual GOMESA revenue sharing caps 
continue thereafter at $500 million per year through 2055, after which 
there will be no caps on GOMESA revenue sharing.

III. Lease Terms and Economic Conditions

    BOEM will offer leases that include certain terms and conditions to 
ensure compliance with the requirements of the OBBBA.

OCS Lease Form

    Pursuant to Section 50102(b)(1)(A) of the OBBBA, BOEM will use Form 
BOEM-2005 (February 2017) to convey leases resulting from this sale. 
This lease form can be viewed on BOEM's website at <a href="http://www.boem.gov/BOEM-2005">http://www.boem.gov/BOEM-2005</a>. The lease form will be amended to include specific terms, 
conditions, and stipulations applicable to the individual lease. The 
final terms, conditions, and stipulations applicable to this sale are 
below.

Primary Terms

    Section 50102(b)(1)(A) of the OBBBA requires that the primary term 
for leases in water depths less than 800 meters to be the same as those 
in Lease Sale 254. Additionally, Section 50102(b)(1)(D) requires a 
primary term of 10 years for leases offered in water depths 800 meters 
or deeper. The primary terms for this sale are summarized in the 
following table:

                         Table 4--Primary Terms
------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Water depth (meters)                     Primary term
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0 to <400............................  The primary term is 5 years; the
                                        lessee may earn an additional 3
                                        years (i.e., for an 8-year
                                        extended primary term) if a well
                                        is spudded targeting
                                        hydrocarbons below 25,000 feet
                                        True Vertical Depth Subsea
                                        (TVDSS) during the first 5 years
                                        of the lease.
400 to <800..........................  The primary term is 5 years; the
                                        lessee will earn an additional 3
                                        years (i.e., for an 8-year
                                        extended primary term) if a well
                                        is spudded during the first 5
                                        years of the lease.
800+.................................  10 years.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. The primary term for a lease in water depths of less than 400 
meters is 5 years. If the lessee spuds a well targeting hydrocarbons 
below 25,000 feet TVDSS within the first 5 years of the lease, then the 
lessee may earn an additional 3 years, resulting in an 8-year primary 
term. The lessee will earn the 8-year primary term when the well is 
drilled to a target below 25,000 feet TVDSS; or the lessee may earn the 
8-year primary term in cases where the well targets, but does not 
reach, a depth below 25,000 feet TVDSS due to mechanical or safety 
reasons that are beyond the lessee's control, and that are supported by 
sufficient evidence from the lessee. To earn the 8-year primary term, 
the lessee is required to submit a letter to the BOEM GOA Regional 
Supervisor, Office of Leasing and Plans, as soon as practicable, but no 
more than 30 days after completion of the drilling operation, providing 
the well number, spud date, information demonstrating a target below 
25,000 feet TVDSS and whether that target was reached, and if 
applicable, any safety or mechanical reasons encountered that prevented 
the well from reaching a depth below 25,000 feet TVDSS. In the letter, 
the lessee must request confirmation from BOEM that the lessee earned 
the 8-year primary term. The BOEM GOA Regional Supervisor for Leasing 
and Plans will confirm in writing, within 30 days of receiving the 
lessee's letter, whether the lessee has earned the extended primary 
term and accordingly update BOEM's records. The extended primary term 
is not effective unless and until the lessee receives confirmation from 
BOEM. A lessee that has earned the 8-year primary term by spudding a 
well with a hydrocarbon target below 25,000 feet TVDSS during the 
standard 5-year primary term of the lease will not be granted a 
suspension for that same period under the regulations at 30 CFR 250.175 
because the lease is not at risk of expiring.
    2. The primary term for a lease in water depths ranging from 400 
meters to less than 800 meters is 5 years. If the lessee spuds a well 
within the first 5 years of the lease, the lessee may earn an 
additional 3 years, resulting in an 8-year primary term. To earn the 8-
year primary term, the lessee is required to submit a letter to the 
BOEM GOA Regional Supervisor, Office of Leasing and Plans, as soon as 
practicable, but no more than 30 days after spudding a well, providing 
the well number and spud date, and requesting confirmation from BOEM 
that the lessee earned the 8-year extended primary term. Within 30 days 
of receipt of the request, the BOEM GOA Regional Supervisor for Leasing 
and Plans will provide written confirmation of whether the lessee has 
earned the extended primary term and accordingly update BOEM's records. 
The extended primary term is not

[[Page 5254]]

effective unless and until the lessee receives confirmation from BOEM.
    3. The primary term for a lease in water depths 800 meters or 
deeper is 10 years.

Minimum Bonus Bid Amounts

    Pursuant to Section 50102(b)(1)(A) of the OBBBA, the minimum bonus 
bids are the same as those used in Lease Sale 254. BOEM will not accept 
a bonus bid unless it provides for a cash bonus in an amount equal to 
or exceeding the specified minimum bid, as described below.
    <bullet> $25 per acre or fraction thereof for blocks in water 
depths less than 400 meters; and
    <bullet> $100 per acre or fraction thereof for blocks in water 
depths 400 meters or deeper.

Rental Rates

    Pursuant to Section 50102(b)(1)(A) of the OBBBA, rental rates are

Escalating Rental Rates for Leases With an 8-Year Primary Term in Water 
Depths Less Than 400 Meters

    Any lessee with a lease in less than 400 meters water depth who 
earns an 8-year primary term will pay an escalating rental rate as 
shown above. The rental rates after the fifth year for blocks in less 
than 400 meters water depth will become fixed and no longer escalate if 
another well is spudded targeting hydrocarbons below 25,000 feet TVDSS 
after the fifth year of the lease, and BOEM concurs that such a well 
has been spudded. In this case, the rental rate will become fixed at 
the rental rate in effect during the lease year in which the additional 
well was spudded.

Minimum Royalty Rate

    Pursuant to Section 50102(b)(1)(A) of the OBBBA, the minimum 
royalty rates are the same as those used in Lease Sale 254:
    <bullet> $7.00 per acre or fraction thereof per year for blocks in 
water depths less than 200 meters; and
    <bullet> $11.00 per acre or fraction thereof per year for blocks in 
water depths 200 meters or deeper.

Royalty Rate

    The royalty rate is the minimum allowed by Section 50102(b)(1)(C) 
of the OBBBA:
    <bullet> 12\1/2\ percent for blocks in all water depths.

Royalty Suspension Provisions

    Pursuant to Section 50102(b)(1)(A) of the OBBBA, the royalty 
suspensions offered in this sale are the same as those offered in Lease 
Sale 254. The Department may issue leases with Royalty Suspension 
Volumes (RSVs) under 30 CFR part 560, which BOEM administers. The 
specific details relating to eligibility and implementation of RSVs and 
other royalty relief programs are found at 30 CFR part 203, which the 
Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement administers.

Royalty Suspension Volumes on Gas Production From Ultra-Deep Wells

    Pursuant to 30 CFR part 203, certain leases issued because of this 
sale may be eligible for RSV incentives on gas produced from ultra-deep 
wells. Under this program, wells on leases in less than 400 meters 
water depth and completed to a drilling depth of 20,000 feet TVDSS or 
deeper receive an RSV of 35 billion cubic feet on the production of 
natural gas. This RSV incentive is subject to applicable price 
thresholds set forth in the regulations at 30 CFR part 203. These 
regulations implement the requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 
(Pub. L. 109-58, 119 Stat. 594 (2005)).

Advance Bonus Bid Deposit Guarantee

    Bidders who are not currently an OCS oil and gas lease record title 
holder or designated operator, or those who have ever defaulted on a 
one-fifth bonus bid deposit, must guarantee (secure) the payment of the 
one-fifth bonus bid deposit, by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or 
otherwise, before bid submission using one of the following four 
methods:
    <bullet> Provide a third-party guarantee;
    <bullet> Amend a development stage area-wide bond via bond rider;
    <bullet> Provide a letter of credit; or
    <bullet> Provide a lump sum payment in advance via EFT.
    Please provide, at the time of bid submittal, a confirmation or 
tracking number for the payment, the name of the company submitting the 
payment as it appears on the payment, and the date the payment was 
submitted so that BOEM can confirm payment with the

[[Page 5256]]

Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). Bidders should submit 
payments to their financial institution at least 5 business days prior 
to bid submittal to ensure that the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
and the U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) have time to 
screen and process payments and that payments are posted to ONRR prior 
to placing the bid. ONRR cannot confirm payment until the monies have 
been moved into settlement status by the U.S. Treasury. Bids will not 
be accepted if BOEM cannot confirm payment with ONRR before 10:00 a.m. 
on Tuesday, March 10, 2026.
    If providing a third-party guarantee, amending a development stage 
area-wide bond via bond rider, or providing a letter of credit to 
secure your one-fifth bonus bid deposit, bidders are urged to file 
these documents with BOEM well in advance of submitting the bid. This 
allows processing time and ensures bidders have time to take any 
necessary curative actions prior to bid submission. For more 
information on EFT procedures, see Section X, ``The Lease Sale.''

Geophysical Data and Information Statement (GDIS)

    The GDIS is composed of five parts:
    1. A ``Statement'' page that includes the company representatives' 
information and separate lists of blocks bid on that used proprietary 
data and those blocks bid upon that did not use proprietary data;
    2. A ``Table'' listing the required data about each proprietary 
survey used (see below);
    3. A ``Survey Parameter Worksheet'' listing acquisition geometry, 
frequency range, fold coverage and processing methods for each survey 
(see below);
    4. ``Maps,'' which contain the live trace maps for each proprietary 
survey and fast-track survey that are identified in the GDIS statement 
and table; and
    5. ``Proprietary geophysical and fast-track SEGY'', not submitted 
previously to BOEM, needs to be submitted along with the GDIS.
    Any bidder who used proprietary seismic data not previously 
submitted to BOEM to evaluate a block in Lease Sale BBG2--or who is a 
joint bidder on such a bid--must submit all five parts of the GDIS at 
the time of bid submission. If only speculative seismic data was used, 
the bidder must submit the GDIS Form and GDIS Table listing all 
speculative data used for each block. A bidder must submit the GDIS 
even if a joint bidder or bidders on a specific block also have 
submitted a GDIS. Any speculative data that has been reprocessed 
externally or ``in-house'' is considered proprietary due to the 
proprietary processing and is no longer considered to be speculative.
    The bidder and joint bidder must submit the GDIS in a separate and 
sealed envelope and must identify all proprietary data; reprocessed 
speculative data, and/or any Controlled Source Electromagnetic surveys, 
Amplitude Versus Offset (AVO) data, gravity data, and/or magnetic data; 
or other data or information used as part of the decision to bid or 
participate in a bid on the block.
    The bidder and joint bidder must also include a live trace map 
(e.g., .pdf and ArcGIS shapefile) for each proprietary and fast-track 
survey identified in the GDIS illustrating the actual areal extent of 
the proprietary geophysical and fast-track data in the survey (see the 
``Example of Preferred Format'' that is included in the Final NOS 
package for additional information). The shape file must not include 
cultural resources information; only the live trace map of the survey 
itself.
    The GDIS statement must include the name, phone number, and full 
address for a contact person and an alternate, who are both 
knowledgeable about the geophysical information and data listed and who 
are available for 30 days after the sale date. The GDIS statement must 
also include a list of all blocks bid upon, including those blocks 
where no proprietary or reprocessed geophysical data and/or proprietary 
information was used, as a basis for the bidder's decision to bid or to 
participate as a joint bidder in the bid. All bidders must submit the 
GDIS statement even if no proprietary geophysical data or information 
was used in its bid preparation for the block.
    Examples of the preferred format of the table and parameter 
worksheet are included in the Final NOS package, and a blank digital 
version of the preferred table and Survey Parameter Worksheet can be 
accessed on the Lease Sale BBG2 website at <a href="https://www.boem.gov/Sale-BBG2">https://www.boem.gov/Sale-BBG2</a>. The GDIS table should have columns that clearly state the 
following:
    <bullet> The sale number;
    <bullet> The bidder's company name;
    <bullet> The joint bidder's company name (if applicable);
    <bullet> The company providing proprietary data to BOEM;
    <bullet> The block area and block number bid upon;
    <bullet> The owner of the original data set (i.e., who initially 
acquired the data);
    <bullet> The industry's original name of the survey (e.g., E 
Octopus);
    <bullet> The BOEM permit number for the survey;
    <bullet> Whether the data set is a fast-track version; BOEM will 
request all fast-track data;
    <bullet> Whether the data is speculative or proprietary;
    <bullet> The data type (e.g., 2-D, 3-D, or 4-D; pre-stack or post-
stack; time or depth);
    <bullet> The migration algorithm (e.g., Kirchhoff migration, wave 
equation migration, reverse migration, reverse time migration) of the 
data and areal extent of bidder survey (i.e., number of line miles for 
2-D or number of blocks for 3-D);
    <bullet> The live proprietary survey coverage (2-D miles 3-D 
blocks);
    <bullet> The computer storage size, to the nearest gigabyte, of 
each seismic data and velocity volume used to evaluate the lease block;
    <bullet> Who reprocessed the data;
    <bullet> The date on which the final reprocessing was completed 
(month and year);
    <bullet> If the data was previously sent to BOEM, list the sale 
number and date of the sale for which it was used;
    <bullet> Whether proprietary or speculative AVO/AVA (PROP/SPEC) was 
used;
    <bullet> The date on which the AVO or AVA was sent to BOEM, if it 
was sent before the sale;
    <bullet> Whether AVO/AVA is time or depth (PSTM or PSDM);
    <bullet> Which angled stacks were used (e.g., NEAR, MID, FAR, 
ULTRAFAR);
    <bullet> Whether the company used Gathers to evaluate the block in 
question; and
    <bullet> List of other Geophysical Data methods used to evaluate 
the bid block (e.g., Inversion, Modeling, Illumination, Grav, Mag).
    BOEM will use the computer storage size information to estimate the 
reproduction costs for each data set, if applicable. BOEM will 
determine the availability of reimbursement of production costs 
consistent with 30 CFR 551.13.
    BOEM reserves the right to inquire about alternate data sets, 
perform quality checks, and compare the listed and alternative data 
sets to determine which data set most closely meets the needs of the 
fair market value determination process. See the ``Example of Preferred 
Format'' that is included in the Final NOS package.

Survey Parameter Worksheet

    The BOEM GOA Region now requires bidders to submit a completed 
electronic version of the Survey Parameters Worksheet alongside any 
Seismic Survey submittal. This worksheet plays a critical role in 
supporting BOEM's Fair Market Value (FMV) Evaluation Methodology, which

[[Page 5257]]

is used to assess the economic value of leases offered in OCS lease 
sales. The data provided in the worksheet allows BOEM to better 
understand the technical scope and intent behind each seismic survey, 
and how those data contribute to subsurface interpretation and 
prospectivity analysis.
    By supplying detailed parameters--such as acquisition geometry, 
frequency range, fold coverage, and processing methods--bidders provide 
BOEM with the context necessary to:
    <bullet> Qualitatively assess the degree of geological 
understanding obtained from the survey;
    <bullet> Evaluate the quality and resolution of seismic imaging, 
which can directly influence the identification of leads and prospects;
    <bullet> Determine the likelihood of successful hydrocarbon 
identification, by considering how the data may mitigate or highlight 
geological risks;
    <bullet> Identify geophysical phenomena (e.g., amplitude anomalies, 
velocity pull-ups, multiples) that could impact the interpretation and 
chance of success;
    <bullet> Assess the commercial implications of the survey in 
supporting new play concepts or de-risking known trends.
    Ultimately, the inclusion of this worksheet enhances the 
transparency and technical rigor behind BOEM's FMV assessments. It 
ensures that economic evaluations are informed by the best available 
subsurface data and geological interpretations, helping to safeguard 
the public interest in OCS resource development.
    Bidders are encouraged to complete the worksheet with care and 
accuracy, as it will directly inform BOEM's ability to fairly and 
accurately evaluate lease block value based on current geoscientific 
insight.

[[Page 5258]]

``Example of Preferred Format'' that is included in the Final NOS 
package for additional information). As previously stated, the 
shapefile must not include cultural resources information, only the 
live trace map of the survey itself.
    Pursuant to 30 CFR 551.12 and 556.501, as a condition of the sale, 
the BOEM GOA RD requests that all bidders and joint bidders submit the 
proprietary data and fast-track data identified on their GDIS along 
with their bid and GDIS packet.
    This includes any proprietary data or fast-track data that has not 
been provided previously to BOEM. Commercially available speculative 
data should not be submitted to BOEM unless specifically requested by 
BOEM. If the bidder is not sure whether the data has been provided 
previously, the bidder should send the proprietary or fast-track. BOEM 
requires all data that are considered proprietary and fast-track to be 
submitted for the evaluation of the bid blocks.
    The proprietary and fast-track data must be submitted to BOEM at 
the following address: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Resource 
Studies, 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard MS-266A, New Orleans, Louisiana 
70123-2394. Please deliver to Mr. Greg Purvis or Mrs. Renee Bigner, 2nd 
Floor, immediately.
    BOEM recommends that bidders mark the submission's external 
envelope as ``Deliver Immediately to DASPU.'' BOEM also recommends that 
bidders submit the GDIS data and Survey Parameter Worksheet in an 
internal envelope, or otherwise marked, with the following designation: 
``Geophysical Data and Information Statement for Oil and Gas Lease Sale 
BBG2, Company Name, GOA Company Qualification Number, and ``Proprietary 
Data.''
    In the event a person supplies any type of data to BOEM, that 
person must meet the following requirements to qualify for 
reimbursement:
    1. Must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM), 
formerly known as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). CCR 
usernames will not work in SAM. A new SAM user account is needed to 
register or update an entity's records. The website for registering is 
<a href="http://SAM.gov">SAM.gov</a>.
    2. Must be enrolled in the U.S. Treasury's Invoice Processing 
Platform (IPP) for electronic invoicing; to enroll go to <a href="https://www.ipp.gov/">https://www.ipp.gov/</a>. Access then will be granted to use the IPP for submitting 
requests for payment. When submitting a request for payment, the 
assigned Purchase Order Number must be included.
    3. Must have a current Online Representations and Certifications 
Application at <a href="http://SAM.gov">SAM.gov</a>.
    Please Note: Digital copies and duplicate hardcopies should be 
submitted for the GDIS Statement, Parameter Sheet, table, shapefiles, 
and maps. The GDIS Statement should be sent in as a digital PDF. The 
GDIS Information Table must be submitted digitally as an Excel 
spreadsheet. The proprietary data and fast-track data maps should be 
sent in as PDF files and the live trace outline of each proprietary 
survey and fast-track survey should also be submitted as a shapefile. 
Please flatten all layered PDF files, since layered PDFs can have many 
objects. Layered PDFs can cause problems opening or printing the file 
correctly. Bidders may submit the digital files on a USB external drive 
(formatted for Windows). Proprietary surveys and fast-track surveys 
should be sent in as regular SEGY files. If bidders have any questions, 
please contact Ms. Dee Smith at (504) 736-2706, or Ms. Teree Campbell 
at (504) 736-3231.
    Bidders should refer to the ``Acceptance, Rejection, or Return of 
Bids'' heading under Section X, ``The Lease Sale,'' regarding a 
bidder's failure to comply with the requirements of the Final NOS, 
including any failure to submit information required in the Final NOS 
package.

Telephone Numbers/Addresses of Bidders

    BOEM requests that bidders provide this information in the 
suggested format prior to or at the time of bid submission. The 
suggested format is included in the Final NOS package. The form must 
not be enclosed inside the sealed bid envelope.

Additional Documentation

    BOEM may require bidders to submit other documents in accordance 
with 30 CFR 556.107, 556.401, 556.501, and 556.513.

VIII. Bidding Rules and Restrictions

Restricted Joint Bidders

    On November 4, 2025, BOEM published the most recent List of 
Restricted Joint Bidders in the Federal Register (90 FR 49242). 
Potential bidders are advised to refer to the Federal Register before 
bidding for the most current list at the time of the lease sale. Please 
refer to the joint bidding provisions at 30 CFR 556.511-556.515.

Authorized Signatures

    All signatories executing documents on behalf of the bidder(s) must 
execute the same in conformance with the BOEM qualification records. 
Bidders are advised that BOEM considers the signed bid to be a legally 
binding obligation on the part of the bidder(s) to comply with all 
applicable regulations, including the required payment of one-fifth of 
the bonus bid on all high bids. A statement to this effect is included 
on each bid form (see the document ``Bid Form and Envelope'' that is 
included in the Final NOS package).

Unlawful Combination or Intimidation

    BOEM warns bidders against violation of 18 U.S.C. 1860, which 
prohibits unlawful combination or intimidation of bidders.

Bid Withdrawal

    Bids may only be withdrawn by written request delivered to BOEM via 
any parcel delivery service, or in-person prior to the bid submission 
deadline. Withdrawals will not be accepted via email. The withdrawal 
request must be on company letterhead and must contain the bidder's 
name, its BOEM qualification number, the map name and number, and the 
block number(s) of the bid(s) to be withdrawn. The withdrawal request 
must be executed by one or more of the representatives named in the 
BOEM qualification records. The name and title of the authorized 
signatory must be typed under the signature block on the withdrawal 
request. The BOEM GOA RD, or the RD's designee, will indicate approval 
by signing and dating the withdrawal request.

Bid Rounding

    Minimum bonus bid calculations, including rounding, for all blocks 
are shown in the document ``List of Blocks Available for Leasing'' that 
is included in the Final NOS package. The bonus bid amount must be 
stated in whole dollars. If the acreage of a block contains a decimal 
figure, then prior to calculating the minimum bonus bid, BOEM will 
round up to the next whole acre. The appropriate minimum rate per acre 
will be applied to the whole (rounded up) acreage. The bonus bid amount 
must be greater than or equal to the minimum bonus bid, as calculated 
and stated in the Final NOS package.

IX. Forms

    The Final NOS package includes instructions, samples, and/or the 
preferred format for the items listed below. BOEM strongly encourages 
bidders to use the recommended formats. If bidders use another format, 
they are responsible for including all the information specified for 
each item in the Final NOS package.

X. The Lease Sale

Bid Opening and Reading

    Sealed bids received in response to the Final NOS will be opened at 
the place, date, and hour specified under the DATES and ADDRESSES 
sections of the Final NOS. The venue will not be open to the public. 
Instead, the bid opening will be available for the public to view on 
BOEM's website at <a href="http://www.boem.gov">http://www.boem.gov</a> via live streaming. Bidders 
participating in Lease Sale BBG2 who have gained the required clearance 
as stated in the ``In-person Bid Submission and/or In-person Bid 
Reading'' section will be allowed to view bid reading in person. The 
opening of the bids is for the sole purpose of publicly announcing and 
recording the bids received; no bids will be accepted or rejected at 
that time.

Bonus Bid Deposit for Apparent High Bids

    Each bidder submitting an apparent high bid must submit a bonus bid 
deposit to ONRR equal to one-fifth of the bonus bid amount for each 
such bid. A copy of the notification of the high bidder's one-fifth 
bonus bid amount can be obtained on the BOEM website at <a href="https://www.boem.gov/Sale-BBG2">https://www.boem.gov/Sale-BBG2</a> under the heading ``Notification of EFT 1/5 
Bonus Liability'' after 1:00 p.m. on the day of the sale. All payments 
must be electronically deposited into an interest-bearing account in 
the U.S. Treasury by 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time the day following the bid 
reading (no exceptions). Account information is provided in the 
``Instructions for Making Electronic Funds Transfer Bonus Payments'' 
found on the BOEM website identified above.
    Bidders must submit payment to their financial institution as soon 
as possible on the day of bid reading and no later than 7:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time on the day of bid reading. This will help ensure that 
deposits have time to process through the U.S. Treasury and post to 
ONRR. ONRR cannot confirm payment until the monies have been moved into 
settlement status by the U.S. Treasury.
    BOEM requires bidders to use EFT procedures for payment of one-
fifth bonus bid deposits for Lease Sale BBG2, following the detailed 
instructions contained on the ONRR Payment Information web page at 
<a href="https://www.onrr.gov/ReportPay/payments.htm">https://www.onrr.gov/ReportPay/payments.htm</a>. Acceptance of a deposit 
does not constitute, and will not be construed as, acceptance of any 
bid on behalf of the United States.

Withdrawal of Blocks

    The United States reserves the right to withdraw any block from 
this lease sale before issuance of a written acceptance of a bid for 
the block.

Acceptance, Rejection, or Return of Bids

    The United States reserves the right to reject any and all bids, 
regardless of the amount offered. Furthermore, no bid will be accepted, 
and no lease for any block will be awarded to any bidder, unless:
    1. The bidder has complied with all applicable regulations and 
requirements of the Final NOS, including those set forth in the 
documents contained in the Final NOS package;
    2. The bid is the highest valid bid; and
    3. The amount of the bid has been determined to be adequate by the 
authorized officer.
    Any bid submitted that does not conform to the requirements of the 
Final NOS, OCSLA, or other applicable statutes or regulations will be 
rejected and returned to the bidder. The United States Department of 
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission will review the results of the 
lease sale for any antitrust issues prior to the acceptance of bids and 
issuance of leases.

Bid Adequacy Review Procedures for Lease Sale BBG2

    To ensure that the U.S. Government receives fair market value for 
the conveyance of leases from this sale, BOEM will evaluate high bids 
in accordance with the bid adequacy procedures that are effective on 
the date of the sale. This is the second lease sale to use the revised 
bid adequacy procedures that BOEM finalized in 2024. The bid adequacy 
procedures are available on BOEM's website at <a href="https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/leasing/bid-adequacy-procedures">https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/leasing/bid-adequacy-procedures</a>.

Lease Award

    BOEM requires each bidder who is awarded a lease to complete the 
following:
    1. Execute all copies of the lease (Form BOEM-2005 [February 2017], 
as amended);
    2. Pay by EFT the balance of the bonus bid amount and the first 
year's rental for each lease issued in accordance with the requirements 
of 30 CFR 1218.155 and 556.520(a); and
    3. Satisfy the bonding requirements of 30 CFR part 556, subpart I, 
as amended.
    ONRR requests that bidders use only one transaction for payment of 
the balance of the bonus bid amount and the first year's rental. Once 
ONRR receives such payment, the bidder awarded the lease may not 
request a refund of the balance of the bonus bid amount or first year's 
rental payment.

XI. Delay of Sale

    The BOEM GOA RD has the discretion to change any date, time, and/or 
location specified in the Final NOS package if the RD deems that an 
emergent event could interfere with a fair and orderly lease sale. Such 
events could include, but are not limited to, natural disasters (e.g., 
earthquakes, hurricanes, floods), wars, riots, acts of terrorism, 
fires, strikes, civil disorder, or other events of a similar nature. In 
case of such events, bidders should call (504) 736-1729 or access the 
BOEM website at <a href="http://www.boem.gov">http://www.boem.gov</a>, for information regarding any 
changes.
