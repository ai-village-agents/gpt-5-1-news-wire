Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production 
Credit 
AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), 
Treasury. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking 
and public hearing. 
SUMMARY: This document contains 
proposed regulations regarding the 
clean fuel production credit enacted by 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and 
amended by the One, Big, Beautiful Bill 
Act (OBBBA). These proposed 
regulations would provide rules for 
determining clean fuel production 
credits, including credit eligibility rules, 
emissions rates, and certification and 
registration requirements. In addition, 
the proposed regulations would amend 
three sets of final regulations: the 
elective payment election regulations 
and the credit transfer election 
regulations, to clarify language relating 
to ownership of clean fuel production 
facilities, and the Federal excise tax 
registration regulations, to make them 
clearer and more consistent with the 
clean fuel production credit registration 
requirements in these proposed 
regulations. The proposed regulations 
would affect domestic producers of 
clean transportation fuel, taxpayers that 
may claim a credit for a related 
producer’s fuel, and excise tax 
registrants. 
DATES: Written or electronic comments 
must be received by April 6, 2026. The 
public hearing is being held on May 28, 
2026, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). 
Requests to speak and outlines of topics 
to be discussed at the public hearing 
must be received by April 6, 2026. If no 
outlines are received by April 6, 2026, 
the public hearing will be cancelled. 
Requests to attend the public hearing 
must be received by 5 p.m. ET on May 
26, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Authority 
This document contains proposed 
amendments to the Income Tax 
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) regarding 
sections 45Z, 1361, 4101, 6417, and 
6418 of the Internal Revenue Code 
(Code) as they relate to the clean fuel 
production credit determined under 
section 45Z (proposed regulations). This 
document also contains proposed 
amendments to the Manufacturers and 
Retailers Excise Tax Regulations (26 
CFR part 48) regarding section 4101 as 
they relate to excise tax registration. The 
proposed regulations would be issued 
under the authority granted by sections 
45Z, 1361(b)(3)(A), 4101(a)(1) and (c), 
4222(c), 6001, 6417(h), 6418(h), and 
7805(a) of the Code. 
Section 45Z contains several 
delegations of authority to the Secretary 
of the Treasury or the Secretary’s 
delegate (Secretary). Section 45Z(e) 
directs the Secretary to issue guidance 
no later than January 1, 2025, regarding 
implementation of section 45Z, 
including calculation of emissions 
factors of transportation fuel, the 
emissions rate table described in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(i), and the determination of 
clean fuel production credits under 
section 45Z. Section 45Z(f)(2) further 
authorizes the Secretary to issue 
regulations regarding the fuel 
production attributable to the taxpayer 
in the case of a facility with multiple 
owners, and section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II) 
authorizes the Secretary to issue 
guidance on certification and other 
information with respect to certain 
transportation fuels. 
Section 45Z(f)(3) authorizes the 
Secretary to prescribe additional related 
person rules for other entities similar to 
the rule described for corporations that 
are members of an affiliated group of 
corporations filing a consolidated 
return. This includes the authority to 
prescribe rules for related persons with 
respect to which the taxpayer has reason 
to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated 
person in a manner described in section 
45Z(a)(4). 
Section 45Z(d)(5)(C) directs the 
Secretary to issue regulations or other 
guidance as the Secretary determines 
necessary to carry out the purposes of 
section 45Z(d)(5)(A)(iv), which excludes 
from the definition of ‘‘transportation 
fuel’’ any fuel produced from a fuel for 
which a credit under section 45Z is 
allowable. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) authorizes the 
Secretary to determine, in the case of 
any transportation fuel that is not a 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), whether 
a model is a successor model to the 
Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, 
and Energy use in Transportation model 
developed by the Argonne National 
Laboratory (ANL). Additionally, section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(i) directs the Secretary, 
subject to section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) 
through (v), to annually publish a table 
setting forth the emissions rate for 
similar types and categories of 
transportation fuels based on the 
amount of lifecycle greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions as described in section 
211(o)(1)(H) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) 
(42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(H)), as in effect on 
August 16, 2022 (CAA–2022) for such 
fuels, expressed as kilograms of 
equivalent carbon dioxide (CO
2e) per 
1,000,000 British thermal units 
(mmBTU), which a taxpayer must use 
for purposes of section 45Z. The 
proposed regulations cite to the CAA– 
2022 as enacted by section 1501(a)(2) of 
the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Public 
Law 109–58, 119 Stat. 594, 1067 (2005), 
amended by section 202(a)(1) of the 
Energy Independence and Security Act 
of 2007, Public Law 110–140, 121 Stat. 
1492, 1521–22 (2007). 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(iv) authorizes the 
Secretary to determine the regulations 
or methodologies for emissions rate 
adjustments to exclude any emissions 
attributed to indirect land use change. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(v)(I) requires the 
Secretary to provide a distinct emissions 
rate with respect to any transportation 
fuel derived from animal manure. The 
emissions rate must be based on the 
specific animal manure feedstock, 
which may include dairy manure, swine 
manure, poultry manure, and any other 
sources that the Secretary determines to 
be appropriate.

5161 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(v)(II) authorizes 
the Secretary to provide an emissions 
rate less than zero with respect to any 
transportation fuel derived from animal 
manure. 
Section 1361(b)(3)(A) authorizes the 
Secretary to prescribe regulations 
providing exceptions to the 
subparagraph’s treatment of a qualified 
subchapter S subsidiary (as defined in 
section 1361(b)(3)(B)) for purposes of 
the Code. 
Section 4101(a)(1) authorizes the 
Secretary to prescribe regulations 
related to any registration required 
under section 4101, including the time, 
form, manner, and terms and conditions 
of such registration. 
Section 4101(c) provides that rules 
similar to the rules of section 4222(c) 
apply to registration under section 4101. 
Section 4222(c) authorizes the Secretary 
to prescribe regulations related to the 
denial, revocation, or suspension of any 
registration under section 4222 if the 
Secretary determines that a registrant 
has used such registration to avoid the 
payment of tax or to postpone or 
interfere with the collection of tax, or 
that such denial, revocation, or 
suspension is needed to protect the 
revenue. 
Section 6001 authorizes the Secretary 
to prescribe regulations related to 
recordkeeping, statements, and special 
returns. 
Section 6417(h) directs the Secretary 
to issue such regulations or other 
guidance as may be necessary to carry 
out the purposes of section 6417. 
Section 6418(h) directs the Secretary 
to issue such regulations or other 
guidance as may be necessary to carry 
out the purposes of section 6418. 
These regulations would also be 
issued under the express delegation of 
authority under section 7805(a) of the 
Code, which authorizes the Secretary to 
prescribe all needful rules and 
regulations for the enforcement of the 
Code, including all rules and 
regulations as may be necessary by 
reason of any alteration of law in 
relation to Internal Revenue. 
Background 
I. Overview 
Section 45Z, added to the Code by 
section 13704 of Public Law 117–169, 
136 Stat. 1818, 1997 (August 16, 2022), 
commonly known as the Inflation 
Reduction Act (IRA), and amended by 
section 70521 of Public Law 119–21, 
139 Stat. 72, 276 (July 4, 2025), 
commonly known as the OBBBA, 
provides an income tax credit (section 
45Z credit) for clean transportation fuel 
produced domestically after December 
31, 2024, and sold by December 31, 
2029. See section 13704(c) of the IRA; 
section 70521(d) of the OBBBA; section 
45Z(g). The section 45Z credit is a 
general business credit under section 38 
of the Code. 
The section 45Z credit replaces an 
assortment of prior fuel incentives. 
Those incentives consisted of income 
tax credit, excise tax credit, and excise 
tax payment provisions for various 
biofuels and other alternative fuels sold 
for use as a fuel or used as a fuel, 
including biodiesel, renewable diesel, 
compressed natural gas, second 
generation biofuel, and SAF. See 
sections 40(b)(6); 40A(b)(1) and (2); 40B; 
6426(c) through (e) and (k); and 6427(e). 
Section 4101 authorizes the Secretary 
to require registration with respect to 
the section 4041 and section 4081 fuel 
excise taxes, and requires registration 
with respect to certain fuel tax credits, 
including the section 45Z credit. 
Section 4101(a)(1), as amended by 
section 70521(i) of the OBBBA, and 
section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) impose a 
registration requirement under section 
4101 (section 4101 registration) on a 
taxpayer claiming the section 45Z 
credit. 
Section 6417, added to the Code by 
section 13801(a) of the IRA, and 
amended by sections 70512(j)(2) and 
70522(c) of the OBBBA, allows an 
applicable entity to elect to treat 
applicable credits (as defined in section 
6417(b)), including the section 45Z 
credit, as a payment against the tax 
imposed by subtitle A of the Code. 
Section 6418, added to the Code by 
section 13801(b) of the IRA, and 
amended by sections 70512(h), 
70513(b)(3)(B)(ii), and 70521(j)(2) of the 
OBBBA, allows an eligible taxpayer to 
elect to transfer eligible credits (as 
defined in section 6418(f)(1)), including 
the section 45Z credit. 
A taxpayer making a section 6417 or 
section 6418 election must also 
complete pre-filing registration, as 
provided in regulations under those 
provisions. This pre-filing registration is 
distinct from the registration required 
for the section 45Z credit, which is done 
under section 4101. 
II. The Section 45Z Credit 
A. Credit Eligibility 
Under section 45Z(a)(1)(A), if a 
taxpayer qualifies for a section 45Z 
credit, the taxpayer is eligible to claim 
a section 45Z credit for the taxable year 
in which the taxpayer sells a 
transportation fuel. To qualify for a 
section 45Z credit, a taxpayer must: (i) 
produce a transportation fuel that meets 
the requirements for suitability, 
emissions rate, coprocessing, and 
prevention of double crediting; (ii) 
produce the fuel at a qualified facility in 
the United States, including in any U.S. 
territories; (iii) be registered as a 
producer of clean fuel under section 
4101 at the time of production; and (iv) 
sell the fuel to an unrelated person in 
a qualified sale during the taxable year. 
See section 45Z(a)(1) and (4), (d)(4), 
(d)(5)(A), and (f)(1). Transportation fuel 
produced after December 31, 2025, must 
be exclusively derived from a feedstock 
that was produced or grown in the 
United States, Mexico, or Canada. See 
section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(iii); section 
70521(a)(2) of the OBBBA. 
A taxpayer also cannot be: (i) a 
specified foreign entity, for taxable years 
beginning after July 4, 2025; or (ii) a 
foreign-influenced entity (other than a 
foreign-influenced entity described in 
section 7701(a)(51)(D)(i)(II) of the Code), 
for taxable years beginning after July 4, 
2027. See sections 45Z(f)(8) and 
7701(a)(51). 
Section 45Z(d)(4) defines ‘‘qualified 
facility’’ as a facility used for the 
production of transportation fuels. 
However, the term ‘‘qualified facility’’ 
excludes any facility for which one of 
the following credits is allowed under 
section 38 for the taxable year: (i) the 
credit for production of clean hydrogen 
under section 45V of the Code (section 
45V credit); (ii) the credit determined 
under section 46 of the Code to the 
extent that such credit is attributable to 
the energy credit determined under 
section 48 of the Code with respect to 
any specified clean hydrogen 
production facility for which an election 
is made under section 48(a)(15) (section 
48(a)(15) election); and (iii) the credit 
for carbon oxide sequestration under 
section 45Q of the Code (section 45Q 
credit). Because these credits cannot be 
stacked with the section 45Z credit, this 
preamble refers to the section 45V 
credit, the section 48(a)(15) election, 
and the section 45Q credit collectively 
as the ‘‘anti-stacking credits’’ and 
individually as an ‘‘anti-stacking 
credit.’’ 
Section 45Z(d)(5)(A) defines 
‘‘transportation fuel’’ as a fuel that 
meets four requirements. First, the fuel 
must be suitable for use as a fuel in a 
highway vehicle or aircraft. Second, the 
fuel must have a lifecycle GHG 
emissions rate (emissions rate) of not 
greater than 50 kilograms (kg) of CO
2e 
per mmBTU. Section 45Z(d)(1) defines 
‘‘mmBTU’’ to mean 1,000,000 British 
thermal units; section 45Z(d)(2) defines 
‘‘CO
2e’’ to mean, with respect to any 
GHG, the equivalent carbon dioxide (as 
determined based on relative global 
warming potential). Third, the fuel must

5162 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
1 Both the preamble to the proposed regulations 
and the proposed regulations use the term 
‘‘unrelated person’’ when describing the 
certification required by section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II). 
Section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II) refers to an ‘‘unrelated 
party,’’ which is synonymous with an unrelated 
person as used in section 45Z(a)(4) and (f)(3). 
2 In determining eligibility for the section 45Z 
credit, a taxpayer must apply the controlled group 
rules under section 52 consistent with the statutory 
purpose of section 45Z. 
not be derived from coprocessing an 
applicable material (or materials derived 
from an applicable material) with a 
feedstock that is not biomass. Section 
45Z(d)(5)(B)(i) defines ‘‘applicable 
material’’ to mean monoglycerides, 
diglycerides, and triglycerides; free fatty 
acids; and fatty acid esters. Section 
45Z(d)(5)(B)(ii) defines ‘‘biomass’’ to 
have the same meaning as in section 
45K(c)(3) of the Code, which provides 
that biomass means any organic material 
other than oil and natural gas (or any 
product thereof), and coal (including 
lignite) or any product thereof. Fourth, 
the fuel must not be produced from a 
fuel for which a section 45Z credit is 
allowable. 
In the case of a taxpayer producing a 
transportation fuel that is SAF, section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II) requires the taxpayer 
to provide certification from an 
unrelated person.
1 For this purpose, 
section 45Z(a)(3) defines ‘‘sustainable 
aviation fuel,’’ which these proposed 
regulations refer to as a ‘‘SAF 
transportation fuel,’’ to mean the non- 
kerosene portion of liquid fuel that is a 
transportation fuel, is sold for use in an 
aircraft, is not derived from palm fatty 
acid distillates or petroleum, and meets 
the requirements of either: (i) ASTM 
International Standard D7566 or (ii) the 
Fischer Tropsch (FT) provisions of 
ASTM International Standard D1655, 
Annex A1. 
Section 45Z(a)(4) requires a taxpayer 
to sell transportation fuel to an 
unrelated person: (i) for use by such 
person in the production of a fuel 
mixture; (ii) for use by such person in 
a trade or business; or (iii) who sells 
such fuel at retail to another person and 
places such fuel in the fuel tank of such 
other person. Section 45Z(f)(3) provides 
that persons are treated as related to 
each other if they would be treated as 
a single employer under the regulations 
prescribed under section 52(b) of the 
Code.
2 Section 45Z(f)(3) further 
provides that if a corporation is a 
member of an affiliated group of 
corporations filing a consolidated 
return, such corporation is treated as 
selling fuel to an unrelated person if 
another member of the group sells the 
fuel to an unrelated person. Section 
45Z(f)(3) also authorizes the Secretary to 
prescribe similar sale attribution rules 
for other related entities, including rules 
for related persons with respect to 
which the taxpayer has reason to believe 
will sell fuel to an unrelated person in 
a manner described in section 45Z(a)(4). 
Section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II) requires a 
taxpayer producing a SAF 
transportation fuel to provide 
certification (in such form and manner 
as the Secretary prescribes) from an 
unrelated person demonstrating 
compliance with: (i) any general 
requirements, supply chain traceability 
requirements, and information 
transmission requirements established 
under the Carbon Offsetting and 
Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation (CORSIA); or (ii) for any 
methodology similar to CORSIA that 
satisfies the criteria under section 
211(o)(1)(H) of the CAA–2022, 
requirements similar to the 
requirements described for CORSIA. A 
taxpayer producing a SAF 
transportation fuel must also provide 
such other information as the Secretary 
may require for purposes of carrying out 
section 45Z. 
B. Credit Amount 
Under section 45Z(a)(1), a taxpayer 
calculates the amount of the section 45Z 
credit by multiplying the applicable 
amount per gallon or gallon equivalent 
with respect to a transportation fuel 
produced by the taxpayer and sold in a 
qualified sale by the emissions factor for 
such fuel. Per section 45Z(a)(5), if the 
credit amount is not a multiple of one 
cent, then it is rounded to the nearest 
cent. A taxpayer’s total section 45Z 
credit for a taxable year is the sum of the 
section 45Z credit for each 
transportation fuel sold during the 
taxable year. 
1. Applicable Amount 
For fuel produced after December 31, 
2025, the applicable amount for any 
transportation fuel is either $0.20 or 
$1.00. See section 45Z(a)(2); section 
70521(g)(2) of the OBBBA. 
For fuel produced on or before 
December 31, 2025, the applicable 
amount varies depending on whether 
the transportation fuel is a SAF 
transportation fuel or is not a SAF 
transportation fuel (non-SAF 
transportation fuel) and is higher for 
SAF transportation fuel than for non- 
SAF transportation fuel. For non-SAF 
transportation fuel, the applicable 
amount is either $0.20 or $1.00. Section 
45Z(a)(2). For SAF transportation fuel, 
the applicable amount is either $0.35 or 
$1.75. Section 45Z(a)(3) (repealed for 
fuel produced after December 31, 2025, 
by section 70521(g)(2) of the OBBBA). 
The increased applicable amount is 
available if the taxpayer produces the 
transportation fuel at a qualified facility 
that satisfies the prevailing wage and 
apprenticeship (PWA) requirements. 
Section 45Z(c)(1) provides that for 
calendar years beginning after 2024, the 
applicable amount must be adjusted by 
multiplying such amount by the 
inflation adjustment factor for the 
calendar year in which the sale of the 
transportation fuel occurs. Section 
45Z(c)(2) provides that the inflation 
adjustment factor for the section 45Z 
credit is the inflation adjustment factor 
determined and published by the 
Secretary pursuant to section 45Y(c), 
determined by substituting ‘‘calendar 
year 2022’’ for ‘‘calendar year 1992’’ in 
section 45Y(c)(3). The inflation 
adjustment factor for purposes of 
section 45Z means, with respect to a 
calendar year, a fraction the numerator 
of which is the gross domestic product 
(GDP) implicit price deflator for the 
preceding calendar year and the 
denominator of which is the GDP 
implicit price deflator for the calendar 
year 2022. In this context, the term 
‘‘GDP implicit price deflator’’ means the 
most recent revision of the implicit 
price deflator for the GDP as computed 
and published by the Department of 
Commerce before March 15 of the 
calendar year. 
If any inflation-adjusted applicable 
amount is not a multiple of one cent, it 
must be rounded to the nearest multiple 
of one cent. Section 45Z(c)(1). 
Section 45Z(f)(6)(A) provides that 
rules similar to the prevailing wage 
requirements of section 45(b)(7) apply. 
Section 45Z(f)(6)(B) provides a special 
rule for qualified facilities placed in 
service before January 1, 2025, under 
which such a facility need only satisfy 
prevailing wage requirements for any 
alteration or repair in taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 2024. 
Section 45Z(f)(7) provides that rules 
similar to the apprenticeship 
requirements of section 45(b)(8) apply. 
Section 1.45Z–3 provides additional 
rules on the PWA requirements under 
section 45Z. 
2. Emissions Factor and Emissions Rate 
Under section 45Z(b)(1)(A), a 
transportation fuel’s emissions factor 
measures the reduction in a fuel’s 
emissions rate, expressed as kg of CO
2e 
per mmBTU, relative to the statutory 
baseline emissions rate of 50 kg of CO
2e 
per mmBTU, expressed as a fraction of 
the statutory baseline. Expressed 
mathematically, the emissions factor 
calculation is as follows: 
(50 kg CO
2e per mmBTU¥emissions 
rate) ÷ 50 kg CO2e per mmBTU

3 See section 13704(b)(5) of the IRA, as amended 
by section 70521(i) of the OBBBA. 
Under section 45Z(b)(2), any 
emissions factor determined under 
section 45Z(b)(1)(A) that is not a 
multiple of 0.1 must be rounded to the 
nearest multiple of 0.1. 
A taxpayer determines a fuel’s 
emissions rate by either using the 
annual emissions rate table published 
by the Secretary or obtaining a 
provisional emissions rate (PER) 
determination from the Secretary. See 
section 45Z(b)(1)(B) and (D). The 
emissions rate may not be less than zero 
for any transportation fuel produced 
after December 31, 2025, except for fuel 
derived from animal manure. See 
section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(v) and (b)(1)(E); 
section 70521(b) and (c)(1) of the 
OBBBA. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i) directs the 
Secretary, subject to section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) through (v), to annually 
publish a table setting forth the 
emissions rates for similar types and 
categories of transportation fuels based 
on the amount of lifecycle GHG 
emissions as described in section 
211(o)(1)(H) of the CAA–2022 for such 
fuels, expressed as kg of CO
2e per 
mmBTU. Section 211(o)(1)(H) of the 
CAA–2022 defines lifecycle GHG 
emissions as ‘‘the aggregate quantity of 
greenhouse gas emissions (including 
direct emissions and significant indirect 
emissions such as significant emissions 
from land use changes), as determined 
by the Administrator [of the 
Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA)], related to the full fuel lifecycle, 
including all stages of fuel and 
feedstock production and distribution, 
from feedstock generation or extraction 
through the distribution and delivery 
and use of the finished fuel to the 
ultimate consumer, where the mass 
values for all greenhouse gases are 
adjusted to account for their relative 
global warming potential.’’ See also 42 
U.S.C. 7602(a). Section 45Z(d)(3) 
provides that ‘‘greenhouse gas’’ has the 
same meaning as under section 
211(o)(1)(G) of the CAA–2022. 
Section 45Z divides transportation 
fuel into two categories for purposes of 
emissions rates: non-SAF transportation 
fuel and SAF transportation fuel. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) and (iii) 
provides the methods for determining 
emissions rates in each case. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) provides that 
for non-SAF transportation fuel, the 
lifecycle GHG emissions of such fuel 
must be based on the most recent 
determinations under the Greenhouse 
gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy 
use in Transportation model developed 
by the ANL, or a successor model as 
determined by the Secretary. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(iii) provides that 
for SAF transportation fuel, the lifecycle 
GHG emissions of such fuel is 
determined in accordance with: (i) the 
most recent CORSIA methodologies that 
have been adopted by the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with 
the agreement of the United States; or 
(ii) any methodology similar to the most 
recent CORSIA methodologies that 
satisfies the criteria under section 
211(o)(1)(H) of the CAA–2022. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(iv) provides that 
for transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025, notwithstanding 
section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i) through (iii), the 
emissions rate must be adjusted to 
exclude any emissions attributed to 
indirect land use change. See section 
70521(c) of the OBBBA. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(v) provides that 
for any transportation fuel derived from 
animal manure and produced after 
December 31, 2025, a distinct emissions 
rate must be provided with respect to 
such fuel based on the specific animal 
manure feedstock. Such an emissions 
rate may be less than zero. See section 
70521(c) of the OBBBA. 
In the case of any transportation fuel 
for which an emissions rate has not 
been established in the annual 
emissions rate table under section 
45Z(b)(1)(B), a taxpayer producing such 
fuel may file a petition with the 
Secretary for determination of the PER 
with respect to such fuel. See section 
45Z(b)(1)(D). 
C. Other Rules 
Section 45Z(f)(2) provides that, if a 
facility has more than one owner, 
production from the facility will be 
allocated among the owners in 
proportion to their respective ownership 
interests in the gross sales from such 
facility, except to the extent provided in 
regulations prescribed by the Secretary. 
Section 45Z(f)(4) provides that under 
regulations prescribed by the Secretary, 
rules similar to the rules of section 52(d) 
will apply to a pass-thru in the case of 
estates and trusts. 
Section 45Z(f)(5) provides that rules 
similar to the rules of section 45Y(g)(6) 
will apply for the allocation of the credit 
to patrons of an agricultural cooperative. 
III. Section 4101 Registration 
Section 4101 of the Code generally 
provides rules for taxpayer registration. 
Section 4101(a)(1) provides a specific 
delegation of authority to the Secretary 
to prescribe the form and manner of 
registration by requiring every person 
required to register under section 4101 
to register with the Secretary at such 
time, in such form and manner, and 
subject to such terms and conditions, as 
the Secretary may by regulations 
prescribe. Section 4101(a)(1) further 
provides that a section 4101 registration 
may be used only in accordance with 
regulations prescribed under section 
4101. Section 4101(a)(5) requires 
reregistration under regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary in the event 
of certain changes in ownership. 
A. Section 45Z Registration 
Requirement 
Section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) provides that 
no section 45Z credit shall be 
determined unless the taxpayer is 
registered as a producer of clean fuel 
under section 4101 at the time of 
production. Section 4101(a)(1) requires 
registration by ‘‘every person producing 
a fuel eligible for the clean fuel 
production credit (pursuant to section 
45Z),’’ effective for transportation fuel 
produced after December 31, 2024.
3 
B. Denial, Revocation, or Suspension of 
Registration 
Under section 4101(c), rules similar to 
the rules of section 4222(c) apply for 
purposes of denial, revocation, or 
suspension of registration under section 
4101. Section 4222 generally requires 
registration for certain tax-free sales 
under section 4221. Section 4222(c) 
provides that under regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary, the 
registration of any person under section 
4222 may be denied, revoked, or 
suspended if the Secretary determines: 
(i) that such person has used such 
registration to avoid the payment of any 
tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code 
(chapter 32), or to postpone or in any 
manner to interfere with the collection 
of any such tax, or (ii) that such denial, 
revocation, or suspension is necessary 
to protect the revenue. The flush 
language of section 4222(c) provides 
that denial, revocation, or suspension 
under section 4222(c) is in addition to 
any penalty provided by law for any act 
or failure to act. 
Section 48.4222(a)–1 provides rules 
for registration, including application 
instructions. Section 48.4222(c)–1 
provides rules for revocation or 
suspension of registration and 
authorizes the IRS in certain 
circumstances to revoke or temporarily 
suspend, upon written notice, the 
registration of any person under section 
4222.

a payment against Federal income taxes 
imposed by subtitle A of the Code equal 
to the amount of the credit. Section 
6417(b)(9) provides that the 45Z credit 
is an applicable credit. 
V. Section 6418 
Section 6418 permits an eligible 
taxpayer to elect to transfer all or a 
portion of an eligible credit determined 
with respect to such taxpayer for any 
taxable year to an unrelated taxpayer. 
Section 6418(f)(1)(A)(viii) provides that 
the section 45Z credit is an eligible 
credit.

Explanation of Provisions 
I. Overview 
A. Section 45Z Regulations 
These proposed regulations include 
six sections relating to section 45Z, 
proposed §§ 1.45Z–1, 1.45Z–2, 1.45Z–4 
through 1.45Z–6, and 1.4101–1. These 
sections, together with existing § 1.45Z– 
3, comprise the ‘‘section 45Z 
regulations’’ referenced in this 
Explanation of Provisions. The section 
45Z regulations would set forth 
provisions to determine the eligibility 
for, and the amount of, the section 45Z 
credit for the production of clean 
transportation fuel. These proposed 
regulations would also provide rules for 
registration and for filing claims for the 
section 45Z credit. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1 would provide 
the definitions of terms generally 
applicable for purposes of the section 
45Z regulations. Proposed § 1.45Z–2 
would provide general rules applicable 
to section 45Z, such as rules for 
determining the amount and timing of 
the credit, including rules for the 
emissions factor and emissions rate for 
transportation fuel and the PER process. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4 would provide 
special rules applicable to section 45Z, 
including required registration, anti- 
stacking, anti-abuse, production 
attribution, facility ownership, foreign 
feedstock and prohibited foreign entity 
restrictions, and recordkeeping and

substantiation rules. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
5 would provide the procedures for 
certification of emissions rates for SAF 
transportation fuel. Proposed § 1.45Z–6 
would provide procedures for claiming 
a section 45Z credit. Proposed § 1.4101– 
1 would provide rules for registration 
under section 4101. 
B. Amendments to Existing Sections 
6417, 6418, and 4101 Regulations 
The proposed regulations would 
amend §§ 1.6417–2(c), 1.6418–2(d), and 
48.4101–1. The proposed amendments 
to §§ 1.6417–2(c)(4) and 1.6418–2(d)(1) 
would clarify that sections 45Z and 
45(d)(3)(C) do not require a taxpayer to 
own the underlying eligible credit 
property. Proposed § 48.4101–1(a)(7) 
would provide that a letter of 
registration is not a determination of tax 
treatment under the Code or a 
determination letter. Proposed 
§ 48.4101–1(a)(8) would provide rules 
for reregistration in the event of a 
change of ownership or a change of 
employer identification number (EIN). 
II. Definitions 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1 would provide 
definitions that apply for purposes of 
section 45Z and the proposed 
regulations. In addition, proposed 
§ 1.45Z–1 would clarify key statutory 
terms as discussed in Parts II.A. through 
II.M. of this Explanation of Provisions. 
The definitions would also adopt the 
statutory language for the terms 
‘‘applicable amount’’ (section 45Z(a)), 
‘‘applicable material’’ (section 
45Z(d)(5)(B)(i)), ‘‘biomass’’ (section 
45Z(d)(5)(B)(ii) (citing section 
45K(c)(3))), ‘‘CO
2e’’ (section 45Z(d)(2)), 
‘‘emissions factor’’ (section 
45Z(b)(1)(A)), ‘‘greenhouse gas (GHG)’’ 
(section 45Z(d)(3)), ‘‘lifecycle GHG 
emissions’’ (section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i)), and 
‘‘mmBTU’’ (section 45Z(d)(1)), and 
identify abbreviations used in the 
proposed regulations, such as ‘‘ASTM,’’ 
‘‘Code,’’ U.S. Department of Energy 
(DOE), EPA, ‘‘Secretary,’’ IRS, ‘‘section 
45Z credit,’’ and ‘‘section 45Z 
regulations.’’ Further, the definitions 
would specify the relevant CORSIA 
methodologies, define an emissions rate 
in accordance with section 45Z(b)(1), 
and define terms associated with the 
PER process (see Part III.F.2. of this 
Explanation of Provisions). 
A. 45ZCF–GREET Model 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(1) would 
define ‘‘45ZCF–GREET model’’ as the 
model by that name developed by the 
ANL and published by the DOE for use 
in determining the amount of lifecycle 
GHG emissions for purposes of section 
45Z. The 45ZCF–GREET model is a user 
interface designed to accept input 
related to a transportation fuel 
production facility, execute calculations 
in the background, and display the full 
lifecycle (in other words, well-to-wheel) 
carbon intensity of produced 
transportation fuel, measured in kg of 
CO
2e per mmBTU.4 The 45ZCF–GREET 
model is currently available at https:// 
www.energy.gov/eere/greet. All publicly 
available versions of the 45ZCF–GREET 
model, the accompanying user manual, 
additional information including FAQs, 
and any log of changes to the model are 
available at https://www.energy.gov/ 
eere/greet. Part III.E.3. of this 
Explanation of Provisions discusses the 
use of the 45ZCF–GREET model for 
purposes of section 45Z(b)(1)(B). 
B. Claim 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(7) would 
define ‘‘claim’’ to mean a completed 
Form 7218, Clean Fuel Production 
Credit, including all required 
information and documentation that a 
taxpayer files with its Federal income 
tax return or Federal information return 
for the taxable year for which the 
section 45Z credit is determined. A 
‘‘claim’’ would include the making of an 
election under section 6417 or section 
6418. The proposed regulation would 
also define ‘‘Form 7218’’ to mean Form 
7218 and any successor form(s). These 
defined terms, coupled with the claim 
filing procedures in proposed § 1.45Z–6, 
would explain how a taxpayer may 
claim a section 45Z credit. 
C. Fuel 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(19) would 
define ‘‘fuel’’ as any liquid or gaseous 
substance that can be consumed to 
supply heat or power. Therefore, for 
purposes of section 45Z, the term ‘‘fuel’’ 
would not include electricity. For an 
additional explanation, see Part II.I.2. of 
this Explanation of Provisions. 
D. Gallon Equivalent 
Section 45Z(a)(1)(A) bases the section 
45Z credit on a gallon (or gallon 
equivalent) of transportation fuel 
without defining the terms or providing 
a baseline for non-liquid fuels. The 
proposed regulations would use a gallon 
measurement for liquid fuels and a 
gallon equivalent for non-liquid fuels. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(20)(i) would 
define ‘‘gallon equivalent’’ for purposes 
of section 45Z(a)(1)(A) to mean, with 
respect to any non-liquid fuel, the 
amount of such fuel that has the energy 
equivalent of a gallon of gasoline, which 
refers to the amount of such fuel that 
has a Btu content of 116,090 (lower 
heating value). The proposed 
regulations would use gasoline as the 
most appropriate baseline fuel for 
determining gallon equivalency because 
gasoline is the most common 
transportation fuel in the United States, 
and section 45Z is designed to 
incentivize domestic production of 
transportation fuels that may serve as 
alternatives to existing fossil fuels. The 
use of a gasoline gallon equivalent is 
also consistent with the gasoline gallon 
equivalent requirement in section 
6426(d)(3), which provided an excise 
tax credit for many of the same types of 
fuel that are eligible for the section 45Z 
credit. Using the gasoline gallon 
equivalent standard in section 
6426(d)(3) in the section 45Z context is 
further supported by the fact that 
section 45Z replaced section 6426(d). 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(20)(ii) would 
provide that a fuel is considered non- 
liquid if it is in a gaseous state at 
ambient pressure and temperature of 1 
atmosphere and 60 degrees Fahrenheit, 
respectively. 
To facilitate implementation of a 
gallon equivalent standard for non- 
liquid fuels, it is necessary to specify 
whether the standard is based on a 
lower heating value or a higher heating 
value of the baseline fuel, as the two 
types of heating values have different 
energy contents. The proposed 
regulations would use a lower heating 
value, rather than a higher heating 
value, because it is a better 
representation of the useful energy 
provided by a transportation fuel. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(20)(iii) would 
explain that the gallon equivalent for a 
non-liquid fuel is calculated by dividing 
the lower heating value of that fuel 
(measured in Btu) by the lower heating 
value of a gallon of gasoline (116,090 
Btu), rounded to 5 decimal places. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(20)(iv) and (v) 
would provide the lower heating values 
of some non-liquid fuels and an 
example of the calculation of a gallon 
equivalent, respectively. 
E. Producer and Taxpayer Treated as a 
Producer 
1. In General 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(26)(i) would 
generally define the term ‘‘producer’’ for 
purposes of section 45Z as the person 
that engages in the production of a 
transportation fuel. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(26)(iii) would provide examples 
illustrating the application of the 
definition. Section 45Z requires the 
taxpayer to be registered as a producer 
of clean fuel but does not specify who 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5166 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
the producer is if the production 
process involves multiple persons and 
multiple steps. The proposed 
regulations would clarify this point. 
2. Producer of Alternative Natural Gas 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(26)(ii) would 
provide that the ‘‘producer’’ of 
alternative natural gas, including 
renewable natural gas (RNG), for 
purposes of section 45Z is the person 
that processes the untreated sources of 
alternative natural gas (processor) to 
remove water, carbon dioxide, and other 
impurities such that it is 
interchangeable with fossil natural gas. 
This definition would be consistent 
with the purpose of section 45Z because 
the processor is the most active 
participant in the production process, 
and section 45Z incentivizes 
production. The definition of 
‘‘producer’’ would therefore exclude 
any person that removes conventional 
or alternative natural gas (CANG) from 
a pipeline, compresses it further after 
removal, and then sells such further- 
compressed CANG (compressor). 
Compression of CANG that is already 
interchangeable with fossil natural gas 
also would not meet the proposed 
definition of ‘‘production’’ (see Part II.F. 
of this Explanation of Provisions). 
Several stakeholders have raised 
questions about who should be 
considered the producer of RNG for 
purposes of section 45Z. The Treasury 
Department and the IRS understand that 
the processor and the compressor are 
typically different persons, and that the 
processor typically performs most of the 
active production and owns (or uses) a 
facility, as that term is defined in 
proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(18). The Treasury 
Department and the IRS further 
understand that the compressor 
typically performs the final compression 
step before a fuel is used in a vehicle 
and typically owns (or uses) only 
compression equipment rather than a 
facility. As a result, the compressor is 
not engaging in production of a 
transportation fuel under section 
45Z(a)(1) and the production standard 
in proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(27), and 
would be unable to meet the 
requirement that transportation fuel be 
produced at a qualified facility as 
provided in section 45Z(d)(4) and 
proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(28). 
F. Production 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(27)(i) would 
define ‘‘production’’ (except for 
purposes of section 45Z(a)(4)(A)) as all 
steps and processes used to make a 
transportation fuel. Production would 
begin with the processing of primary 
feedstock(s) and end with a 
transportation fuel ready to be sold in a 
qualified sale. Production would not 
include instances in which a person 
uses a primary feedstock to produce a 
fuel that meets the same ASTM standard 
as the primary feedstock. The definition 
of ‘‘production’’ would also incorporate 
the rules in section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(ii) and 
(f)(1)(B) requiring production to occur in 
the United States. 
The definition of ‘‘production’’ would 
further clarify that minimal processing 
would not qualify as production for 
purposes of the section 45Z credit. 
Minimal processing would generally 
include creating a fuel mixture or 
otherwise engaging in activities that do 
not result in a chemical transformation. 
However, with respect to CANG, 
production would include processing 
untreated sources of alternative natural 
gas to remove water, carbon dioxide, 
and other impurities such that it is 
interchangeable with fossil natural gas. 
Production of CANG would not include 
compressing CANG that is already 
interchangeable with fossil natural gas 
to a higher pressure. 
Under the proposed regulations, the 
blending of a transportation fuel into 
another fuel to create a fuel mixture, 
regardless of whether the fuel mixture 
itself satisfies the requirements of 
section 45Z(d)(5)(A), would not 
constitute production of a transportation 
fuel because the blending process would 
constitute minimal processing. For 
example, the blending of ethanol and 
gasoline would not constitute 
production of a transportation fuel. 
Further, importing fuel that is largely 
finished fuel and undergoes only 
minimal processing in the United States 
would not constitute production. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(27)(ii) would 
provide examples of minimal 
processing, including instances in 
which the same person engages in 
production and subsequent blending. 
In enacting section 45Z, Congress 
replaced fuel credits and payments that 
specifically incentivize blending 
(including the credits under sections 
40B and 6426(k), and the payment 
under section 6427(e)) with the section 
45Z production credit. Congress’s shift 
from blending incentives to a 
production incentive demonstrates that 
Congress no longer intended to 
incentivize blending. Therefore, 
equating production with blending 
would be contrary to Congress’s purpose 
in enacting section 45Z. 
G. Qualified Facility 
1. Facility 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(18) would 
define a ‘‘facility,’’ as used in section 
45Z(d)(4) and the proposed regulations, 
to mean a single production line that 
produces a transportation fuel and 
would include all components that 
function interdependently to produce a 
transportation fuel. The definition of 
‘‘facility’’ would also clarify the 
treatment of indirect, post-production, 
and multipurpose equipment. The 
definition would, for instance, exclude 
CANG compression equipment from a 
facility because it is post-production 
equipment. The definition would 
include examples involving carbon 
capture equipment and SAF 
transportation fuel. 
The proposed definition of ‘‘facility’’ 
is neutral as to geographic proximity of 
the components of the production line 
and focuses instead on interdependent 
pieces of equipment used to produce 
transportation fuel. This definition is 
consistent with how provisions of the 
Code under which similar tax credits 
are determined define ‘‘facility.’’ It is 
also consistent with stakeholders’ 
requests that a facility be narrowly 
defined to minimize overlap with other 
credits and their concerns that physical 
boundaries may be inadequate. 
Accordingly, the proposed definition 
considers that a section 45Z facility may 
be co-located with another credit- 
eligible facility, and that some 
production equipment may be located 
upstream or downstream from, or in a 
different building than, other 
equipment. 
2. Qualified Facility 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(28)(i) would 
incorporate the definitions of ‘‘qualified 
facility’’ in section 45Z(d)(4) and 
‘‘facility’’ in proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(18) 
and clarify that a ‘‘qualified facility’’ 
must satisfy the anti-stacking rules in 
section 45Z(d)(4)(B) and proposed 
§ 1.45Z–4(b). Proposed § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(28)(ii) would define the term ‘‘anti- 
stacking credit’’ to mean any of the three 
credits listed in section 45Z(d)(4)(B). 
H. Qualified Sale 
The draft regulatory text in the 
Appendix to Notice 2025–10 used the 
term ‘‘qualifying sale.’’ The proposed 
regulations would instead use the term 
‘‘qualified sale.’’ Proposed § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(29) would define a ‘‘qualified sale’’ 
as a sale of a transportation fuel in a 
manner described in section 45Z(a)(4). 
The definition would also: (i) clarify the 
term ‘‘sold for use in a trade or 
business’’ for purposes of section 
45Z(a)(4)(B); (ii) incorporate the sale 
attribution rule in section 45Z(f)(3) if 
fuel is sold by another member of the 
taxpayer’s consolidated group (as 
defined in § 1.1502–1(b) and (h), 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5167 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
respectively); and (iii) prescribe an 
additional sale attribution rule, as 
authorized by section 45Z(f)(3), for fuel 
sold by a related person if the taxpayer 
is not a member of a consolidated group. 
The draft regulatory text in the 
Appendix to Notice 2025–10 defined 
the term ‘‘sold for use in a trade or 
business’’ to mean sold for use as a fuel 
in a trade or business within the 
meaning of section 162 of the Code. The 
term did not include a sale for blending 
or for further processing, including use 
as a primary feedstock to produce 
another fuel. Many stakeholders raised 
concerns about the interpretation of 
‘‘sold for use in a trade or business.’’ 
They noted that in the fuel industry, 
many producers sell to related or 
unrelated intermediaries, such as 
wholesalers or dealers, rather than 
directly to unrelated final purchasers. 
They asserted that the ‘‘use as a fuel’’ 
language could prevent all sales for 
resale, such as those to intermediary 
dealers or wholesalers, from qualifying 
for the section 45Z credit. These 
stakeholders requested that the ‘‘use as 
a fuel’’ language be removed and that 
the phrase ‘‘use . . . in a trade or 
business’’ be incorporated as written in 
section 45Z(a)(4)(B). Stakeholders also 
said that a ‘‘use as a fuel’’ limitation 
could undercut the language in section 
45Z(d)(5)(A), which requires only that a 
transportation fuel be ‘‘suitable for use 
as a fuel in a highway vehicle or 
aircraft,’’ but not actually so used. 
The proposed regulations would 
adopt the stakeholders’ suggestion to 
remove the ‘‘use as a fuel’’ language 
from the definition of ‘‘sold for use in 
a trade or business.’’ Under the 
proposed regulations, ‘‘trade or 
business’’ would have the same 
meaning as in section 162 of the Code. 
The meaning of ‘‘sold for use’’ would be 
determined under these proposed 
regulations and would apply solely for 
purposes of section 45Z. The proposed 
regulations would also explicitly clarify 
that the term ‘‘sold for use in a trade or 
business’’ includes the sale of fuel to an 
unrelated person that subsequently 
resells the fuel in its trade or business. 
The proposed regulations retain the 
draft regulatory text from the Appendix 
to Notice 2025–10 that excludes a sale 
for blending from the definition of ‘‘sold 
for use in a trade or business.’’ A sale 
for blending (if made to an unrelated 
person) would qualify as a sale for use 
in the production of a fuel mixture 
under section 45Z(a)(4)(A) and 
proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(29)(i)(A). 
Therefore, including a sale for blending 
in the ‘‘sold for use in a trade or 
business’’ definition, which relates to 
section 45Z(a)(4)(B), would render a 
significant part of section 45Z(a)(4)(A) 
superfluous. 
The proposed regulations do not 
retain the draft regulatory text from the 
Appendix to Notice 2025–10 that 
defined ‘‘sold for use in a trade or 
business’’ to exclude a sale for further 
processing, including use as a primary 
feedstock to produce another fuel. To 
prevent double crediting, the OBBBA 
amended section 45Z(d)(5) to exclude 
from the definition of a ‘‘transportation 
fuel’’ any fuel produced from a fuel for 
which a section 45Z credit is allowable. 
See section 70521(e) of the OBBBA. 
This statutory revision suggests that a 
sale for use as a primary feedstock to 
produce another fuel may qualify as a 
sale for use in a trade or business under 
section 45Z(a)(4)(B). The proposed 
regulations would align the definition of 
‘‘sold for use in a trade or business’’ 
with the statutory language. 
The proposed regulations would 
further define ‘‘sold for use in a trade or 
business’’ to exclude a sale of fuel to a 
reseller that subsequently sells the fuel 
at retail to another person and places 
the fuel in the tank of such other person. 
Such a sale (if made to an unrelated 
person) would be a qualified sale under 
section 45Z(a)(4)(C) and proposed 
§ 1.45Z–1(b)(29)(i)(C). Therefore, 
inclusion of such sales in the definition 
of ‘‘sold for use in a trade or business,’’ 
which relates to section 45Z(a)(4)(B), 
would render section 45Z(a)(4)(C) 
superfluous. 
As noted earlier, the proposed 
definition of ‘‘sold for use in a trade or 
business’’ gives meaning to section 
45Z(a)(4)(A) and (C) and is consistent 
with a plain reading of section 
45Z(a)(4)(B). The proposed definition is 
also consistent with the ‘‘suitable for 
use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or 
aircraft’’ language in section 
45Z(d)(5)(A). 
The draft regulatory text in the 
Appendix to Notice 2025–10 
incorporated the sale attribution rule in 
section 45Z(f)(3) for fuel sold by another 
member of the taxpayer’s consolidated 
group. Many stakeholders requested the 
adoption of a broader ‘‘look-through’’ 
rule for sales made through related 
intermediaries, so that a taxpayer would 
be treated as selling fuel to an unrelated 
person if a related person (for example, 
a related intermediary dealer or 
wholesaler) ultimately sold the fuel to 
an unrelated person. The stakeholders 
pointed to similar look-through rules 
that the Treasury Department and the 
IRS adopted with regard to credits 
under sections 45 and 45J of the Code 
in Notice 2008–60, 2008–30 I.R.B. 178, 
and Notice 2023–24, 2023–13 I.R.B. 571, 
respectively. The stakeholders 
expressed that many fuel producers are 
not organized as corporations and 
cannot utilize the sale attribution rule 
under section 45Z(f)(3). 
After the release of Notice 2025–10, 
the OBBBA added rulemaking authority 
to section 45Z(f)(3) that allows the 
Secretary to prescribe additional 
related-person sale attribution rules 
similar to the statutory rule. See section 
70521(f) of the OBBBA. Based on this 
new grant of authority, the proposed 
regulations would adopt the 
stakeholders’ suggestion regarding a 
broader look-through rule for sales made 
through related persons. Proposed 
§ 1.45Z–1(b)(29)(iv) would provide that, 
for purposes of section 45Z, a taxpayer 
that is not a member of a consolidated 
group is treated as selling fuel to an 
unrelated person if a related person sells 
the fuel to the unrelated person. This 
rule would apply to all sales made by 
related persons except those specifically 
addressed in section 45Z(f)(3) and 
proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(29)(iii). 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(29)(v) would 
provide examples illustrating the 
definition of ‘‘qualified sale,’’ including 
the ‘‘sold for use in a trade or business’’ 
definition as it relates to section 
45Z(a)(4)(B), the sale attribution rule for 
fuel sold by another member of a 
taxpayer’s consolidated group, the sale 
attribution rule for fuel sold by a related 
person (other than another member of a 
taxpayer’s consolidated group), and a 
sale made by a taxpayer that produces 
and subsequently blends a 
transportation fuel. 
I. Transportation Fuel 
1. In General 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(34) would 
define ‘‘transportation fuel’’ as provided 
in section 45Z(d)(5)(A), and would also 
define associated terms. The proposed 
regulations would define the term 
‘‘suitable for use as a fuel in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft’’ (suitable for use) to 
mean that the fuel has practical and 
commercial fitness for use as a fuel in 
a highway vehicle or aircraft, or may be 
blended into a fuel mixture that has 
practical and commercial fitness for use 
as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft. 
The proposed definition of ‘‘suitable for 
use’’ is consistent with longstanding 
excise tax rules under § 48.4081–1(c)(2) 
of the Manufacturers and Retailers 
Excise Tax Regulations, with which the 
fuel industry is familiar. 
The proposed regulations would also 
clarify that actual use as a fuel in a 
highway vehicle or aircraft is not 
required. For example, diesel fuel that 
has practical and commercial fitness for 
use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5168 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
aircraft, but is ultimately used as marine 
fuel, would satisfy the ‘‘suitable for use’’ 
standard. The proposed regulations 
would further provide that CANG is 
suitable for use once it is produced so 
that it is interchangeable with fossil 
natural gas and would require only 
minimal processing (for example, 
further compression or liquefaction) to 
meet the specifications of ASTM D8080. 
In addition, the proposed regulations 
would also provide that a fuel that does 
not require further processing and that 
may be blended with or used as a 
component of taxable fuel (within the 
meaning of section 4083 of the Code) is 
suitable for use. 
The proposed regulations would 
define the term ‘‘produced from a fuel 
for which a section 45Z credit is 
allowable,’’ as used in section 
45Z(d)(5)(A)(iv), to mean that a fuel has 
a primary feedstock that meets the 
definition of a transportation fuel under 
section 45Z (without regard to section 
45Z(d)(5)(A)(iv)). This proposed rule 
would prevent double crediting by 
ensuring that only the first 
transportation fuel in a production 
chain qualifies for a section 45Z credit. 
See section 70521(e) of the OBBBA. 
Thus, if one fuel is used as a primary 
feedstock to produce a second fuel, and 
the first fuel qualifies as a transportation 
fuel for purposes of section 45Z, the 
second fuel would not qualify for a 
section 45Z credit. For instance, SAF 
produced from ethanol as a primary 
feedstock, and hydrogen produced from 
RNG as a primary feedstock, may not 
qualify as transportation fuel for 
purposes of section 45Z. However, a 
fuel could still qualify for a section 45Z 
credit if its production process uses a 
transportation fuel solely as a process 
fuel or other non-primary-feedstock 
input. 
The proposed regulations would 
provide examples illustrating the 
definitions of ‘‘suitable for use’’ and 
‘‘produced from a fuel for which a 
section 45Z credit is allowable.’’ 
2. Electricity 
The proposed regulations would not 
include electricity in the definition of 
‘‘transportation fuel,’’ for several 
reasons. Electricity production would 
therefore be ineligible for the section 
45Z credit. 
First, at the time section 45Z was 
enacted, the Code contained an 
assortment of income tax credit, excise 
tax credit, and excise tax payment 
provisions for various biofuels and other 
alternative fuels sold for use as a fuel or 
used as a fuel. These included 
incentives for biodiesel, renewable 
diesel, and several different alternative 
fuels (including compressed natural gas 
and second generation biofuel). Joint 
Committee on Taxation, General 
Explanation of Tax Legislation Enacted 
in the 117th Congress, JCS 1–23, at 278 
(Dec. 31, 2023). Congress designed the 
section 45Z credit to replace these 
incentives, which were only available 
for liquid or gaseous fuels. See sections 
40(b)(6); 40A(b)(1) and (2); 40B; 6426(c) 
through (e) and (k); 6427(e). Therefore, 
for purposes of section 45Z, it would be 
reasonable to understand the term 
‘‘fuel’’ as referring to a liquid or gaseous 
substance that can be consumed to 
supply heat or power. As a result, the 
term ‘‘transportation fuel’’ under the 
proposed regulations would not include 
electricity. 
Second, the anti-stacking rules in 
section 45Z(d)(4)(B) disallow receiving 
both a section 45Z credit and certain 
other credits with respect to the same 
facility for a taxable year. See proposed 
§ 1.45Z–1(b)(28)(ii) (definition of anti- 
stacking credit); Part IV.B. of this 
Explanation of Provisions (discussion of 
anti-stacking rules). 
The inclusion of the anti-stacking 
rules indicates that Congress understood 
the potential for activity at a particular 
facility to generate multiple credits for 
a taxable year and wished to foreclose 
that possibility. However, the section 
45Y clean electricity production credit 
is not included in the anti-stacking 
rules, which indicates that the 
production of electricity is not eligible 
for the section 45Z credit. Thus, 
Congress’s omission of the section 45Y 
credit from the anti-stacking rules 
suggests that Congress did not 
understand the term ‘‘fuel’’ to include 
electricity for purposes of section 45Z. 
Further, Notice 2025–10, which stated 
that the forthcoming proposed 
regulations intended to exclude 
electricity as a transportation fuel, was 
published approximately 6 months 
before the enactment of the OBBBA. 
Though the OBBBA amended certain 
aspects of section 45Z discussed in 
Notice 2025–10, including the 
definition of ‘‘transportation fuel,’’ the 
OBBBA did not amend or clarify the 
definition of ‘‘transportation fuel’’ to 
include electricity. 
Third, the Code already provides a 
separate credit for clean electricity 
production under section 45Y. When 
Congress created the section 45Z credit, 
it also created the section 45Y credit. 
Generally, the section 45Y credit is not 
limited based on how the electricity is 
ultimately used. If the definition of 
‘‘transportation fuel’’ in section 45Z 
were to include electricity, there would 
be significant overlap between the 
electricity eligible for a credit under 
section 45Z and the electricity eligible 
for a credit under section 45Y. Further, 
a reading of section 45Z to include 
electricity in the definition of 
‘‘transportation fuel’’ would not be 
consistent with Congressional intent in 
separately enacting section 45Y to 
incentivize clean electricity production 
and section 45Z to incentivize 
production of clean transportation fuel. 
J. Non-SAF Transportation Fuel 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(24)(i) would 
define ‘‘non-SAF transportation fuel’’ 
for purposes of section 45Z as any 
transportation fuel that is not a SAF 
transportation fuel. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(24)(ii) would provide a non- 
exclusive list of non-SAF fuels that may 
qualify as a transportation fuel, as well 
as descriptions of such fuels. A non- 
SAF fuel described in proposed 
§ 1.45Z–1(b)(24)(ii) would also need to 
meet all the other applicable 
requirements under section 45Z to 
qualify as a transportation fuel. The list 
of non-SAF fuels would generally track 
those fuels listed in section 3.03 of 
Notice 2024–49. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(24)(ii) would also retain a few 
modifications that Notice 2025–10 made 
to the definitions in Notice 2024–49 to 
address concerns raised by stakeholders. 
Consistent with Notice 2025–10, the 
proposed regulations would clarify the 
description of low-GHG CANG, 
including the ASTM D8080 reference, 
and would list ASTM D1152 (neat 
methanol) as a specification for low- 
GHG methanol in addition to ASTM 
D5797 (fuel blend methanol). 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
are cognizant of existing business 
practices in which producers make fuel 
that may not meet all the proposed 
ASTM specifications for that particular 
fuel. Therefore, the proposed ASTM 
specifications would be both non- 
exhaustive and non-exclusive with 
respect to determining whether a fuel is 
a transportation fuel for purposes of 
section 45Z. Prescribing exclusive fuel- 
by-fuel specifications in these proposed 
regulations would be impractical and 
may unintentionally restrict future 
market developments. The Treasury 
Department and the IRS request 
comments on this general approach and 
whether in some cases additional 
specificity is needed. 
K. SAF Transportation Fuel 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(30) would 
define ‘‘SAF transportation fuel’’ to 
mean SAF as defined in section 
45Z(a)(3), and would also define 
associated terms. Further, the proposed 
regulations would clarify that a 
synthetic blending component sold to a 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5169 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
person that blends the fuel into a fuel 
mixture described in ASTM D7566 is 
‘‘sold for use in an aircraft’’ within the 
meaning of section 45Z(a)(3). 
L. Types and Categories of 
Transportation Fuel 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(35) would 
define the term ‘‘type of transportation 
fuel’’ as a particular kind of fuel, and 
the term ‘‘category of transportation 
fuel’’ as the unique primary feedstock 
and pathway used to produce a type of 
transportation fuel. The definitions 
would clarify those terms as used in 
section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i). 
M. Unrelated Person 
Consistent with section 45Z(f)(3), 
proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(36) would define 
the term ‘‘unrelated person’’ as a person 
not related to the taxpayer. The term 
‘‘unrelated party’’ has the same meaning 
as ‘‘unrelated person’’ for purposes of 
the certification required by section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II)(aa). The definition 
would also incorporate the related 
person definition in section 45Z(f)(3). 
III. General Rules 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2 would provide 
general rules regarding the section 45Z 
credit. The proposed regulations would 
incorporate and clarify the rules in 
section 45Z(a) through (c) regarding the 
amount of the credit, the credit 
calculation, the timing of the credit, 
emissions factors, and emissions rates 
(including the emissions rate table and 
the PER process). 
A. Amount of Credit 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(a)(1) would 
incorporate and clarify the credit 
calculation rules in section 45Z(a)(1). 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(a)(2) would provide 
that the volume of a liquid fuel is 
measured on the basis of gallons 
adjusted to ambient pressure and 
temperature of 1 atmosphere and 60 
degrees Fahrenheit. The proposed rule 
would reference proposed § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(20)(ii) and (iii), respectively, for the 
determination of whether a fuel is liquid 
or non-liquid and the calculation of the 
gallon equivalent of a non-liquid fuel. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(a)(3) would 
provide rules and examples for the 
calculation of the section 45Z credit. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(a)(3)(i) would 
implement the rounding rule provided 
in section 45Z(a)(5) for credit amounts 
and would clarify that the rule applies 
only after multiplying the applicable 
amount, quantity of fuel, and emissions 
factor. Proposed § 1.45Z–2(a)(3)(ii) 
would require pro rata allocation for 
sales of transportation fuel produced 
after December 31, 2024, and held in 
common storage with other fuels. 
Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, 
the applicable amount meant either the 
base amount provided in section 
45Z(a)(2)(A) or the alternative amount 
provided in section 45Z(a)(2)(B), with 
an increased base amount and 
alternative amount for SAF 
transportation fuel under section 
45Z(a)(3)(A). Section 70521(g)(2) of the 
OBBBA eliminated the increased base 
amount and alternative amount for SAF 
transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
2(a)(4) would define the term 
‘‘applicable amount’’ in accordance 
with section 45Z(a)(2), as amended by 
the OBBBA. Under the proposed 
definition, the alternative amount 
would apply in the case of any 
transportation fuel produced at a 
qualified facility that satisfies the PWA 
requirements. The base amount would 
otherwise apply in the case of any 
transportation fuel produced at a 
qualified facility that does not satisfy 
the PWA requirements. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(a)(4)(iv) would 
implement the inflation adjustment 
mechanics for the applicable amount 
provided under section 45Z(c), 
including the inflation adjustment factor 
as provided in section 45Z(c)(2). In 
Notice 2025–37, the Treasury 
Department and the IRS published the 
section 45Z inflation adjustment factor 
for calendar year 2025. The section 45Z 
inflation adjustment factor for 
subsequent calendar years will also be 
published in the Internal Revenue 
Bulletin. 
B. Timing of Credit 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(b)(1) would 
clarify that a taxpayer is eligible to 
claim the section 45Z credit only for the 
taxable year in which a qualified sale of 
a transportation fuel occurs, provided 
the taxpayer meets all other 
requirements to claim the credit. See 
section 45Z(a)(1)(A)(ii). Proposed 
§ 1.45Z–2(b)(2) would incorporate the 
effective date in section 13704(c) of the 
IRA, which provides that section 45Z 
applies to transportation fuel produced 
after December 31, 2024. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(b)(3)(i) would 
clarify that a transportation fuel may be 
produced in an earlier taxable year than 
the taxable year in which the qualified 
sale of the fuel occurs, but that a 
qualified sale may not occur before the 
date the fuel is produced. As a result, if 
a taxpayer sells transportation fuel 
before production, the qualified sale 
would occur on the date of production. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(b)(3)(ii) would 
provide that a qualified sale occurs at 
the time of the taxpayer’s sale to the 
unrelated person, or if a related-person 
sale attribution rule applies, at the time 
of the related person’s sale to the 
unrelated person. 
C. Emissions Factor 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(c)(1) would 
incorporate the definition of ‘‘emissions 
factor’’ provided under section 
45Z(b)(1)(A). Proposed § 1.45Z–2(c)(2) 
would incorporate the emissions factor 
rounding rule in section 45Z(b)(2) and 
provide an example. 
D. Emissions Rate 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(d)(1) would 
incorporate the rules for determining 
the emissions rate of a transportation 
fuel in section 45Z(b)(1)(B) and (D). To 
determine an emissions rate for a fuel, 
a taxpayer would either use the 
applicable emissions rate table 
published by the Secretary or, if the 
applicable emissions rate table does not 
establish an emissions rate for the 
taxpayer’s fuel, a PER determined by the 
Secretary. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(d)(2) would 
incorporate section 70521(b) and (c)(1) 
of the OBBBA, which provide that for 
transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025, the emissions rate 
cannot be less than zero, unless such 
fuel is derived from animal manure. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(v), which was 
added by section 70521(c)(1) of the 
OBBBA, provides that, notwithstanding 
that general rule, the Secretary ‘‘may 
provide an emissions rate that is less 
than zero’’ for a transportation fuel 
derived from an animal manure 
feedstock such as dairy, swine, or 
poultry manure. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
2(d)(2) would clarify that the limitation 
regarding negative emissions rates also 
applies to any transportation fuel used 
as a production input. The proposed 
rule would provide examples 
illustrating the negative-emissions-rate 
limitation and the effect of a negative 
emissions rate on the emissions factor 
calculation. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(d)(3) would 
incorporate the rule in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(iv), which was added by 
section 70521(c)(1) of the OBBBA, that 
excludes emissions attributed to 
indirect land use changes for 
transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025. 
As discussed in Part III.E. and III.F. of 
this Explanation of Provisions, under 
proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(2), the applicable 
emissions rate table would direct a 
taxpayer to use the allowed 
methodologies described in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) and (iii) and set out in 
proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(3), and any PER

5170 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
would be determined pursuant to 
section 45Z(b)(1)(D) and the procedures 
in proposed § 1.45Z–2(f). 
E. Emissions Rate Table 
1. In General 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e) would 
incorporate the rules in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B) regarding the annual 
publication of a table of emissions rates 
for similar types and categories of 
transportation fuels (emissions rate 
table), including the requirement in 
section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i) that the 
emissions rate table be published 
‘‘[s]ubject to’’ the requirements in 
section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) through (v). 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
will annually publish an emissions rate 
table for each calendar year in the 
Internal Revenue Bulletin. The annual 
emissions rate table for calendar year 
2025 was published in Notice 2025–11. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(2) would 
provide rules for identifying the 
applicable emissions rate table that a 
taxpayer must use in a given taxable 
year. Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(2)(i) would 
clarify that the applicable emissions rate 
table for a taxpayer is the emissions rate 
table that is in effect on the first day of 
the taxpayer’s taxable year of 
production. The proposed rule would 
also clarify that, for production after 
December 31, 2024, in taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 2025, the 
applicable emissions rate table is the 
emissions rate table effective for 2025. 
In response to Notice 2025–10, 
stakeholders requested the ability to use 
an emissions rate table tied to the year 
construction of a facility began, 
regardless of when the taxpayer actually 
produces a transportation fuel. If a 
taxpayer begins constructing a facility in 
2025 but such facility does not begin 
producing fuel until a subsequent 
calendar year, the stakeholders’ 
requested rule would allow the taxpayer 
to use the emissions rate table for 2025 
to determine the emissions rate of its 
fuel for all taxable years. 
The proposed regulations would not 
adopt this suggestion. Section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(i) directs the Secretary to 
annually publish an emissions rate table 
and requires taxpayers to use such 
tables. The statute does not contemplate 
taxpayers locking in the use of old 
tables in later years. Additionally, the 
amount of the section 45Z credit 
depends in part on the emissions rate of 
the transportation fuel produced in a 
given taxable year. Accordingly, the 
emissions rate of a fuel is properly 
established using the emissions rate 
table in effect for the taxable year in 
which such fuel was produced. The 
beginning of construction date for the 
facility in which the fuel is produced 
has no significance with respect to 
emissions rates and is unrelated to the 
actual emissions associated with the 
production of transportation fuel after 
the facility is placed in service. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(2)(ii) would 
clarify that if a taxpayer produces a fuel 
for which the applicable emissions rate 
table establishes an emissions rate, the 
taxpayer must use the corresponding 
allowed methodologies, as specified in 
proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(3), as provided in 
such table to determine the emissions 
rate for all such fuel produced during 
the taxpayer’s taxable year. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(2)(iii)(A) 
would clarify that the applicable 
emissions rate table establishes the 
emissions rate for a fuel if the emissions 
rate table includes both the type and 
category of that fuel. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
2(e)(2)(iii)(B) would clarify that if an 
emissions rate table does not initially 
include a type or category of fuel, but 
an allowed methodology is updated to 
add such type or category of fuel during 
the calendar year, then that type or 
category of fuel is considered included 
in such emissions rate table. 
The proposed regulations would 
generally require a taxpayer to use the 
latest annual emissions rate table (as 
opposed to prior annual tables) and 
would prevent the use of outdated 
modeling. 
2. Allowed Methodologies 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(3)(i) would 
provide that a taxpayer producing a fuel 
for which an emissions rate is 
established by the applicable emissions 
rate table must determine the fuel’s 
emissions rate using the allowed 
methodologies described in proposed 
§ 1.45Z–2(e)(3)(iv) and (v), as directed 
by the applicable emissions rate table. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(3)(ii) would 
require a taxpayer to use the first 
version of an allowed methodology that 
is publicly available in the taxable year 
of production and that includes the type 
and category of the taxpayer’s fuel. 
However, if an updated version of an 
allowed methodology becomes publicly 
available after the first day of the taxable 
year of production (but still within such 
taxable year), then the taxpayer could 
choose to treat such updated version as 
the most recent version of such 
methodology. This choice would give a 
taxpayer the flexibility to choose the 
version of an allowed methodology to 
use with respect to taxable years for 
which an updated version of a 
methodology may be published during a 
taxpayer’s taxable year of production. 
This would generally ensure that a 
taxpayer uses the latest modeling and 
benefits from favorable updates to a 
methodology, but would not penalize a 
taxpayer if a methodology is updated 
unfavorably during the taxable year. 
The proposed regulations would 
address the requirement in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(i) that the emissions rate 
table be published ‘‘[s]ubject to’’ the 
requirements in section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) 
through (v). Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e)(3)(iv) 
and (v) would identify the allowed 
methodologies for determining 
emissions rates for purposes of the 
emissions rate table described in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(i). If the applicable 
emissions rate table establishes the 
emissions rate for a non-SAF 
transportation fuel, a taxpayer 
producing such fuel would determine 
the fuel’s emissions rate using the 
45ZCF–GREET model, as directed by 
the applicable emissions rate table. If 
the applicable emissions rate table 
establishes the emissions rate for a SAF 
transportation fuel, a taxpayer 
producing such fuel would determine 
the fuel’s emissions rate using the most 
recent version of the CORSIA Default 
Life Cycle Emissions Values for CORSIA 
Eligible Fuels lifecycle approach 
(CORSIA Default) or the CORSIA 
Methodology for Calculating Actual Life 
Cycle Emissions Values lifecycle 
approach (CORSIA Actual), with the 
agreement of the United States, or the 
45ZCF–GREET model, as directed by 
the applicable emissions rate table. The 
proposed regulations would also clarify 
that, for a given type and category of 
SAF transportation fuel, a taxpayer must 
use the same methodology to calculate 
lifecycle GHG emissions associated with 
all stages of fuel feedstock production 
and distribution. 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i) requires the 
emissions rate table to be based on the 
amount of lifecycle GHG emissions (as 
described in section 211(o)(1)(H) of the 
CAA–2022) for such fuels. Section 
211(o)(1)(H) of the CAA–2022 defines 
lifecycle GHG emissions as the aggregate 
emissions from all stages of the fuel’s 
production and use, including feedstock 
production and transportation, fuel 
production and distribution, and use of 
the finished fuel. This type of lifecycle 
analysis is referred to as ‘‘well-to- 
wheel’’ emissions analysis. As a result, 
for each type and category of 
transportation fuel, the 45ZCF–GREET 
model also uses ‘‘well-to-wheel’’ 
emissions to calculate lifecycle GHG 
emissions for all stages of fuel 
production, as well as emissions 
resulting from use of the fuel in 
transportation. 
Section 70521(c)(1) of the OBBBA 
provides that for fuel produced after

5171 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
December 31, 2025, notwithstanding the 
CAA reference in section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i), 
the emissions rate of a transportation 
fuel shall exclude any emissions 
attributed to indirect land use change. 
See section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(iv). 
3. 45ZCF–GREET Model 
a. In General 
Section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) provides that 
in the case of non-SAF transportation 
fuel, the lifecycle GHG emissions of 
such fuel must be based on the most 
recent determinations under the 
Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, 
and Energy use in Transportation model 
developed by the ANL, or a successor 
model (as determined by the Secretary). 
The DOE changed the name of the 
‘‘Greenhouse gases, Regulated 
Emissions, and Energy use in 
Transportation’’ model to ‘‘Greenhouse 
gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy 
use in Technologies’’ in 2020 and it is 
now generally referred to as the 
‘‘GREET’’ model. 
The GREET model refers to a suite of 
models, the first version of which was 
released in 1995 and is now called the 
Research & Development Greenhouse 
gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy 
use in Technologies (R&D GREET) 
model. Since 1995, the DOE maintained 
the GREET model to enable research 
regarding lifecycle analyses of hundreds 
of different methods of producing, 
delivering, and using energy. The R&D 
GREET model was not designed to be 
used for determining emissions rates for 
tax credits, including the section 45Z 
credit, but the current suite of GREET 
models includes different versions, 
some of which are designed to facilitate 
particular regulatory regimes. 
As of February 4, 2026 the DOE’s 
GREET website lists the following 
different versions of the GREET model: 
R&D GREET, 40BSAF–GREET, 45VH2– 
GREET, 45ZCF–GREET, CA–GREET4.0, 
and ICAO–GREET. See https://
energy.gov/eere/greet. For purposes of 
the section 45Z credit, the phrase ‘‘most 
recent determinations under the 
Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, 
and Energy use in Transportation 
model’’ in section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) is best 
understood as referring to the most 
recent determinations under the 45ZCF– 
GREET model. As discussed in Part 
III.E.3.b. of this Explanation of 
provisions, the proposed regulations 
would also designate the 45ZCF–GREET 
as a successor model to the GREET 
model under section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii). 
Some stakeholders have suggested 
that the R&D GREET model should be 
used for the section 45Z credit. 
However, the 45ZCF–GREET model is 
the only appropriate GREET model to 
use for purposes of the section 45Z 
credit because the R&D GREET model is 
not limited to transportation fuels and 
includes information that is based on 
preliminary analyses (that is, analyses 
that are not yet complete, have 
significant technical uncertainties, or 
are still being reviewed by laboratory 
staff, the DOE staff, or independent 
experts). See generally GREET, Office of 
Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 
DOE, available at https://
www.energy.gov/eere/greet. 
While the R&D GREET model is a 
valuable tool for characterizing the 
benefits and impacts of energy 
technologies in a directional manner 
and testing new and updated data and 
parameters, it is designed to provide 
flexibility in user-defined parameters 
and methodological choices for a wide 
variety of research purposes and thus 
not appropriate for use in policy 
applications without modifications. 
Because the R&D GREET model offers 
users many choices regarding analysis 
methodology (for example, co-product 
accounting method and global warming 
potential values), different users can 
calculate different emissions rates with 
respect to the same fuel. Many of these 
choices would not be appropriate for the 
specific context of the section 45Z credit 
given the potentially preliminary nature 
of much of the information represented 
in R&D GREET and given that specific 
representations of activities, and their 
emissions, are needed in a specific 
fashion (for example, to comply with 
the requirements of section 45Z). Given 
the limitations of some of the data 
underlying aspects of the R&D GREET 
model and the fact that the model does 
not predetermine for the user the 
methodologies and accounting 
parameters that are appropriate for 
compliance with the requirements of 
section 45Z, R&D GREET does not 
provide the analytical and 
methodological specificity necessary to 
meet the specific objectives or statutory 
requirements of the section 45Z credit. 
ANL developed, and the DOE 
published, the 45ZCF–GREET model as 
a specific version of the GREET model 
to determine emissions rates that also 
meets three key parameters: (i) user- 
friendliness and consistency, (ii) 
technical robustness of the pathways 
represented, and (iii) consistency with 
the requirements of section 45Z. The 
45ZCF–GREET model and the 45ZCF– 
GREET User Manual are available at 
https://www.energy.gov/eere/greet. The 
first version of the 45ZCF–GREET 
model, released on January 15, 2025, 
included the most commonly used types 
and categories of fuel that are 
anticipated to meet the eligibility 
requirements to claim the section 45Z 
credit. The 45ZCF–GREET model and 
the 45ZCF–GREET User Manual were 
updated in May 2025; such updates 
included adding pathways for 
alternative natural gas from coal mine 
methane capture and ethanol from U.S. 
corn wet mills. Additional types and 
categories of fuel may be added in 
future versions of the 45ZCF–GREET 
model. 
Implementation of the section 45Z 
credit requires that data used to 
calculate emissions rates reflect a given 
taxpayer’s specific operations and that 
such data be independently verifiable to 
the extent possible. Use of facility- 
specific verifiable data ensures that the 
section 45Z credit is available only to 
those fuels that meet statutory 
requirements. For certain parameters, 
bespoke inputs are unlikely to be easily 
measured by taxpayers and/or 
independently verifiable with high 
fidelity, given the current status of 
verification mechanisms. Thus, certain 
parameters in the 45ZCF–GREET model 
are fixed assumptions, referred to as 
‘‘background data,’’ that are based on 
the best available data and may not be 
changed by users. Alternatively, the 
‘‘foreground data’’ in the 45ZCF–GREET 
model are parameters that must be input 
by the user. The 45ZCF–GREET User 
Manual contains further details on 
background and foreground data. 
b. 45ZCF–GREET as a Successor Model 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
recognize that the continued existence 
of the R&D GREET model and periodic 
updates to both the 45ZCF–GREET 
model and the R&D GREET model may 
create uncertainty about which GREET 
model to use. To address any potential 
uncertainty, the proposed regulations 
would invoke the Secretary’s express 
delegation of authority in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) to require use of the 
45ZCF–GREET model as a successor 
model. 
In drafting the proposed regulations, 
the Treasury Department and the IRS 
considered the statutory definition of 
the term ‘‘lifecycle greenhouse gas 
emissions’’ in section 211(o)(1)(H) of the 
CAA–2022 and the specific objectives of 
section 45Z. The Treasury Department 
and the IRS also consulted with the 
DOE. Accordingly, the proposed 
regulations would reflect that the 
45ZCF–GREET model is a model 
specifically developed by the ANL as a 
derivative of and successor to the R&D 
GREET model to meet the requirements 
and objectives of section 45Z.

2025-EPA-letter-to-UST-on-45zcf-GREET- 
signed.pdf. 
8 The 45ZCF–GREET model includes significant 
indirect emissions from land use, crop production, 
and livestock. Due to the OBBBA, indirect 
emissions from land use, also known as induced or 
indirect land use change, will be excluded for 
purposes of transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025. See section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(iv); 
section 70521(c) of the OBBBA. 
c. Most Recent Determinations Under 
GREET 
Regardless of any determination by 
the Secretary of a successor model, the 
phrase ‘‘most recent determinations 
under the Greenhouse gases, Regulated 
Emissions, and Energy use in 
Transportation model’’ in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii) can be understood to 
refer to determinations under the most 
recent version of the 45ZCF–GREET 
model. 
As discussed in Part III.E.3.a. of this 
Explanation of Provisions, the 45ZCF– 
GREET model is tailored to the 
administration of the section 45Z credit 
and includes features that make it easy 
for taxpayers to use. Use of the most 
recent version of the 45ZCF–GREET 
model would also ensure that the 
pathways and approaches provided for 
determining ‘‘well-to-wheel’’ emissions 
for various fuel production processes 
are of sufficient methodological 
certainty to be appropriate for 
determining eligibility for a tax credit. 
d. SAF Portion of 45ZCF–GREET Model 
as a Similar Methodology 
The proposed regulations would 
allow taxpayers to use the 45ZCF– 
GREET model to determine emissions 
rates for SAF transportation fuel (SAF 
portion of 45ZCF–GREET model). The 
SAF portion of the 45ZCF–GREET 
model is a ‘‘similar methodology’’ to 
CORSIA under section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II) because, like the 
CORSIA fuel lifecycle methodologies, it 
evaluates the full fuel lifecycle, 
including all stages of fuel and 
feedstock production through to the end 
use of the finished fuel. The DOE 
worked with the Treasury Department 
and other Federal agencies to develop 
the 45ZCF–GREET model, including 
specifications for and limitations on 
background and foreground data, to 
satisfy the statutory requirements of 
section 45Z. Additionally, in the context 
of whether the R&D GREET model could 
be used to determine lifecycle GHG 
emissions for purposes of section 
40B(e)(2),
5 the EPA identified certain 
necessary components of a lifecycle 
GHG analysis consistent with section 
211(o)(1)(H) of the CAA–2022 that the 
R&D GREET model lacked. The EPA 
subsequently determined that the new 
40BSAF–GREET 2024 model, created in 
2024 for the now-expired SAF credit 
under section 40B, included the 
previously identified absent categories 
of emissions.
6 Similarly, the EPA found 
that the 45ZCF–GREET model includes 
the categories of emissions it previously 
identified as missing from the R&D 
GREET model, the lack of which made 
R&D GREET insufficient for calculating 
lifecycle GHG emissions for purposes of 
section 211(o)(1)(H) of the CAA–2022.
7 
The 45ZCF–GREET model contains 
certain necessary components of a 
lifecycle GHG analysis consistent with 
section 211(o)(1)(H) of the CAA–2022 as 
applied for purposes of the section 45Z 
regulations.
8 The 45ZCF–GREET model 
is consistent with the requirements of 
section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(iii). Therefore, 
emissions rates for SAF transportation 
fuels calculated using the 45ZCF– 
GREET model would also be consistent 
with those requirements as applied for 
purposes of the section 45Z regulations. 
See section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i). 
e. Other Aspects of 45ZCF–GREET 
Model 
In the 45ZCF–GREET model, for 
purposes of accounting for emissions 
associated with hydrogen (as a 
production input), natural gas 
alternatives (as a production input or as 
the transportation fuel produced), 
electricity, and carbon capture and 
sequestration, rules similar to the rules 
under section 45V would apply unless 
otherwise specified by the 45ZCF– 
GREET model with respect to technical 
modeling issues or other technical 
differences. The proposed regulations 
would also clarify the similar rule for 
incrementality with respect to the use of 
energy attribute certificates in the 
45ZCF–GREET model. See also § 1.45V– 
4(d). 
In January 2025, the United States 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
published a beta version of the USDA 
Feedstock Carbon Intensity Calculator 
(USDA FD–CIC). The beta version of the 
USDA FD–CIC is undergoing testing, 
peer review, and public comment in 
preparation for the publication of a final 
version of USDA FD–CIC. Following 
publication of the final version of USDA 
FD–CIC, the Treasury Department and 
the IRS anticipate that a section 45Z- 
specific version of the Feedstock Carbon 
Intensity Calculator (FD–CIC) module 
will be included as an input to the 
DOE’s 45ZCF–GREET model (45ZCF 
FD–CIC) used for calculating carbon 
intensity adjustments under section 45Z 
for feedstocks that are produced using 
certain agricultural practices. Such 
practices may include no till, reduced 
till, cover crops, and nutrient 
management. 45ZCF FD–CIC may 
undergo periodic updates, including 
incorporation of new data and 
methodologies from other FD–CIC 
versions (for example, USDA FD–CIC, 
R&D GREET FD–CIC (R&D FD–CIC)), to 
incorporate more recent data or new 
data sources, types of practices, 
feedstock types, or changes to 
geographic specificity. The results of the 
45ZCF FD–CIC are expected to inform 
the emissions rates calculated under the 
45ZCF–GREET model. The Treasury 
Department and the IRS anticipate that 
45ZCF FD–CIC may be used for fuel 
produced and sold in 2025 even though 
45ZCF FD–CIC likely will be published 
in 2026. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
anticipate that adoption of 45ZCF FD– 
CIC would entail additional 
requirements particular to its use, such 
as agricultural practice implementation, 
recordkeeping, and verification, which 
may include rules similar to those 
provided in the USDA’s technical 
guidelines for crops used as biofuel 
feedstocks in 7 CFR 2100, subparts D, E, 
and F. The Treasury Department and the 
IRS anticipate publishing additional 
guidance on these requirements in 
coordination with the publication of 
45ZCF FD–CIC. 
F. Provisional Emissions Rate (PER) 
1. In General 
Many stakeholders have expressed the 
urgent need for guidance to clarify the 
scope and mechanics of the PER process 
referenced in section 45Z(b)(1)(D), 
which provides that if the emissions 
rate table does not establish an 
emissions rate for a transportation fuel, 
a taxpayer producing such fuel may file 
a petition with the Secretary for 
determination of the emissions rate with 
respect to such fuel, known as a ‘‘PER.’’ 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(1) would 
establish the procedures a taxpayer 
must follow to request a PER

5173 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
determination. The proposed 
regulations would require a taxpayer to 
submit an emissions value request 
(EVR) to the DOE and obtain a 
calculated emissions value letter (CEVL) 
from the DOE, prior to filing a PER 
petition. 
2. PER Terminology 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b) would define 
terms associated with the PER 
procedures set out in proposed § 1.45Z– 
2(f). Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(12) would 
define ‘‘eligible fuel,’’ for purposes of 
the PER procedures in proposed 
§ 1.45Z–2(f) and the associated 
definitions in proposed § 1.45Z–1(b), as 
either a type of fuel not included in the 
applicable emissions rate table, or a type 
of fuel included in the applicable 
emissions rate table but whose category 
is not included in the applicable 
emissions rate table. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b) would also 
define terms related to requesting an 
emissions value (EV) from the DOE, 
which would be a prerequisite to filing 
a PER petition. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(15) would define the term 
‘‘emissions value’’ or ‘‘EV’’ as the value 
setting forth the DOE’s analytical 
assessment of the lifecycle GHG 
emissions associated with the fuel for 
which the EVR was made. Proposed 
§ 1.45Z–1(b)(17) would define the term 
‘‘EV applicant’’ as a taxpayer submitting 
an EVR for an eligible fuel to the DOE. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(6) would define 
the term ‘‘calculated emissions value 
letter’’ or ‘‘CEVL’’ as the letter setting 
forth the emissions value and DOE 
control number that the DOE issues to 
an applicant whose EVR is completed. 
3. Threshold Requirements 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(2) would 
provide that the DOE and the IRS, 
respectively, will deny any EVR or PER 
petition for a type and category of fuel 
included in the applicable emissions 
rate table. The proposed rule would 
provide that a taxpayer may only 
request an emissions value, and 
subsequently a PER determination, for 
an eligible fuel. Because the section 45Z 
credit is computed for a type and 
category of fuel, the proposed rule 
would also clarify that the DOE and the 
IRS, respectively, will deny any EVR or 
PER petition based on a facility rather 
than a type or category of fuel. 
4. Emissions Value Requests 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(3) would 
describe the rules for requesting an EV 
from the DOE for an eligible fuel. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(3)(i) would direct 
applicants to follow the guidance and 
procedures that the DOE will separately 
publish for EVRs, including the section 
45Z EVR process instructions 
(Instructions). Proposed § 1.45Z– 
2(f)(3)(i) would also describe common 
assumptions for EVRs, including the 
well-to-wheel system boundary and 
certain accounting rules. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(3)(ii) would 
describe the information required by the 
DOE for an EVR. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
2(f)(3)(ii)(A) would generally require 
that an EV applicant provide all 
information required by the DOE’s 
Instructions, including sections of a 
Class 3 Front-End Engineering and 
Design (FEED) study (or studies) or 
other indicator of project maturity, as 
determined by the DOE, and a 
completed Section 45Z EVR Form. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(3)(ii)(B) would 
provide that for an EVR for an eligible 
fuel that is a category of hydrogen, an 
EV applicant must first submit a section 
45V Emissions Value Request 
Application in accordance with the 
process for a PER determination for the 
section 45V credit, as described in 
§ 1.45V–4(c). The proposed rule would 
provide that the EV applicant must 
submit the letter obtained under the 
section 45V EVR process from the DOE 
stating the well-to-gate emissions value 
that the DOE determined with respect to 
the facility’s hydrogen production 
pathway and the control number that 
the DOE assigned to the section 45V 
EVR Application. Once such applicant 
completes the section 45V EVR process 
and submits its EVR for purposes of 
section 45Z, the DOE may issue a CEVL, 
which would include an EV that fully 
accounts for the well-to-wheel 
emissions of such category of hydrogen. 
The proposed rule would also clarify 
that if the EV applicant produces such 
category of hydrogen at multiple 
facilities, such applicant will need to 
provide this information for each 
facility. See Part IV.B. of this 
Explanation of Provisions for a 
discussion of the anti-stacking rules 
between section 45Z and section 45V. 
5. Submitting a PER Petition 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(4) would 
provide the exclusive procedures for 
requesting a PER determination. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(4)(i) would clarify 
that a taxpayer requests a PER 
determination by filing a PER petition 
with the Form(s) 7218 included with the 
taxpayer’s timely filed (including 
extensions) Federal income tax return or 
Federal information return for the first 
taxable year for which the taxpayer 
claims the section 45Z credit for the 
eligible fuel to which the PER petition 
relates. Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(4)(ii) 
would describe the required content of 
a PER petition, which would consist of 
the CEVL for each eligible fuel for 
which the section 45Z credit is being 
claimed for a given taxable year. 
6. Determination of a PER 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(5)(i) would 
provide that a properly filed PER 
petition is deemed accepted by the IRS, 
and that the deemed acceptance 
constitutes the Secretary’s 
determination of the PER. As such, 
proposed § 1.45Z–2(f)(5)(ii) would 
clarify that a taxpayer may rely on the 
EV the DOE provides in a CEVL for 
purposes of calculating and claiming the 
section 45Z credit, provided that all 
information, representations, or other 
data the taxpayer provided to the DOE 
in support of the taxpayer’s EVR are 
accurate. 
G. Relation Back of Emissions Rates 
(Including PER) 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(g) would provide 
that when an emissions rate is first 
determined for a type and category of 
fuel, whether established in an 
applicable emissions rate table or by a 
PER determination, that emissions rate 
will relate back to January 1, 2025. The 
proposed rule would ensure that even if 
a taxpayer cannot determine the 
emissions rate for a type and category of 
fuel at the time of production, either 
because such type and category of fuel 
are not established in the applicable 
emissions rate table or because the 
Secretary has not determined a PER, 
such taxpayer may utilize a later- 
determined emissions rate for such fuel 
as of the date of production. 
IV. Special Rules 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4 would provide 
special rules with respect to the 
determination of a section 45Z credit. 
Generally, these rules would address 
the: (i) required registration at the time 
of production; (ii) anti-stacking rules; 
(iii) anti-abuse rules; (iv) attribution of 
production; (v) lack of ownership 
requirement; (v) foreign feedstocks and 
prohibited foreign entities; and (vi) 
specific recordkeeping and 
substantiation requirements. 
A. Only Registered Production in the 
United States Taken Into Account 
As provided in section 45Z(f)(1), 
proposed § 1.45Z–4(a) would provide 
that no section 45Z credit is determined 
with respect to any transportation fuel 
unless the taxpayer is registered as a 
producer of clean fuel (within the 
meaning of section 4101) at the time of 
production and the fuel is produced in 
the United States, which includes any 
territory of the United States. Proposed

5174 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
§ 1.4101–1, which would provide the 
registration rules under section 4101, is 
further discussed in Part VII. of this 
Explanation of Provisions. 
B. Anti-Stacking Rules 
As previously discussed in Part II.G.2. 
of this Explanation of Provisions, 
section 45Z(d)(4)(B) disallows a section 
45Z credit for fuel produced at a facility 
for which an anti-stacking credit (as 
defined in proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(28)(ii)) 
is allowed. Proposed § 1.45Z–4(b) 
would provide anti-stacking rules that 
would govern the interaction between 
different credits if a facility both 
produces transportation fuel under 
section 45Z and engages in other credit- 
eligible activity. The proposed rule also 
includes examples. To the extent 
permitted by statute, the proposed rule 
would generally preserve taxpayer 
choice of which credit to claim—a 
section 45Z credit or an anti-stacking 
credit—for a taxpayer engaging in 
multiple credit-eligible activities at the 
same facility in a taxable year. For 
instance, a taxpayer producing 
hydrogen that qualifies for both a 
section 45V credit and a section 45Z 
credit can generally choose which credit 
to claim. 
In addition to general comments on 
the proposed anti-stacking rules, the 
Treasury Department and the IRS 
request specific comments addressing 
situations in which a facility either has 
multiple owners or in which a taxpayer 
does not own the facility, including 
administrative and compliance issues 
arising under those scenarios. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4(b)(2) would 
provide that the determination of 
whether a facility is a qualified facility 
is made each taxable year. Therefore, 
under the proposed rule, a facility may 
be a qualified facility in one taxable year 
but not in another taxable year. 
Additionally, in the case of a taxpayer 
producing transportation fuel at 
multiple facilities, the taxpayer would 
separately determine for each facility 
whether the fuel was produced at a 
qualified facility. The proposed rules 
are consistent with the anti-stacking 
rules in section 45Z(d)(4)(B), which are 
tied to the taxable year. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4(b)(3) would 
provide examples illustrating the 
application of the anti-stacking rules to 
section 45Z for each of the anti-stacking 
credits. One example would address 
situations in which the person claiming 
an anti-stacking credit for a facility has 
a different taxable year than the 
taxpayer producing transportation fuel 
at that facility. The examples would also 
clarify that the anti-stacking rules apply 
regardless of whether the taxpayer or 
another person claims an anti-stacking 
credit with respect to a facility. 
C. Anti-Abuse Rules 
As indicated in Notice 2025–10, the 
Treasury Department and the IRS are 
cognizant of potential abuses of the 
section 45Z credit, including situations 
in which a taxpayer produces and sells 
transportation fuel in a manner that is 
inconsistent with Congressional intent 
in enacting section 45Z. The Treasury 
Department and the IRS are also 
concerned about other potential abuse, 
such as circular production, credit 
churning or wasteful production with 
no intended use, and abuse of the anti- 
stacking rules. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4(c) would provide 
that the rules of section 45Z and the 
section 45Z regulations must be applied 
in a manner consistent with the 
purposes of section 45Z and the section 
45Z regulations (and the regulations in 
under sections 6417 and 6418 related to 
the section 45Z credit), including 
incentivizing the domestic production 
and use of clean transportation fuel and 
ensuring that taxpayers do not 
circumvent the feedstock origin and 
anti-stacking rules. Therefore, the 
proposed rule would provide that no 
section 45Z credit is determined if the 
primary purpose of the production and 
sale of clean transportation fuel is to 
obtain the benefit of the section 45Z 
credit in a manner that is wasteful, such 
as discarding, disposing of, or 
destroying the transportation fuel 
without putting it to a productive use. 
The proposed rule would further 
provide that whether the production 
and sale of transportation fuel is 
consistent with the purposes of section 
45Z and the section 45Z regulations 
(and the regulations in this chapter 
under sections 6417 and 6418 related to 
the section 45Z credit) is based on all 
facts and circumstances. 
Section 45Z(e) delegates authority to 
the Secretary to issue guidance 
regarding implementation of section 
45Z, including the determination of 
section 45Z credits. Therefore, the 
proposed regulations would provide 
general anti-abuse rules that are 
consistent with the three prongs of the 
section 45Z(a)(4) definition of ‘‘sale’’ 
(referred to as a ‘‘qualified sale’’ in these 
proposed regulations) that focus on 
post-production uses of transportation 
fuel. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
request comments on the need for these 
or additional section 45Z anti-abuse 
rules. The Treasury Department and the 
IRS also request comments on the 
potentially abusive scenarios that 
should be covered by any anti-abuse 
rules. 
D. Production Attributable to the 
Taxpayer and Section 761(a) Elections 
Consistent with section 45Z(f)(2), 
proposed § 1.45Z–4(d) would provide 
rules for production attributable to the 
taxpayer. For a facility in which more 
than one person has an ownership 
interest (and the arrangement is not 
classified as a partnership for Federal 
tax purposes), proposed § 1.45Z–4(d)(1) 
would provide that production from the 
facility is allocated among those persons 
in proportion to their respective 
ownership interests in the gross sales 
from the facility. The proposed rule 
would further provide that each owner’s 
respective allocable share of the section 
45Z credit is based on each owner’s 
allocable share of production, 
determined pursuant to section 45Z and 
these proposed regulations. Proposed 
§ 1.45Z–4(d)(2) would provide an 
example of production attributable to 
the taxpayer. Proposed § 1.45Z–4(d)(3) 
would address instances in which a 
facility is owned pursuant to a valid 
section 761(a) election. 
E. Facility Ownership Not Required 
Credit eligibility under section 45Z is 
tied to production of a transportation 
fuel at a qualified facility and a 
subsequent qualified sale of the fuel. 
There is no statutory requirement that 
the producer of the transportation fuel 
own the qualified facility. Proposed 
§ 1.45Z–4(e) would address situations in 
which the producer does not own the 
qualified facility at which it produces 
the transportation fuel, to ensure that 
production is attributed fairly and 
accurately in those situations. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4(e)(1) would 
clarify that a taxpayer is not required to 
own the qualified facility at which it 
produces transportation fuel for a 
section 45Z credit to be determined 
with respect to such fuel. If a taxpayer 
produces transportation fuel at a 
qualified facility owned by another 
person, proposed § 1.45Z–4(e)(2) would 
attribute that production to the taxpayer 
unless otherwise specified in the Code 
or the section 45Z regulations. In the 
case of a production arrangement under 
which multiple taxpayers produce 
transportation fuel at a facility that is 
not owned by all the taxpayers, 
production would be allocated among 
the taxpayers in proportion to their 
respective interests in the gross sales 
from that fuel, as determined under the 
applicable contract or other legal 
arrangement with respect to the fuel.

5175 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
F. Foreign Feedstock and Prohibited 
Foreign Entity Restrictions 
Consistent with section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(iii), as added by section 
70521(a) of the OBBBA, proposed 
§ 1.45Z–4(f)(1) would provide that 
transportation fuel that is produced after 
December 31, 2025, must be exclusively 
derived from a feedstock that was 
produced or grown in the United States, 
Mexico, or Canada. 
Consistent with section 45Z(f)(8), as 
added by section 70521(k) of the 
OBBBA, proposed § 1.45Z–4(f)(2) would 
prohibit the determination of a section 
45Z credit: (i) for taxable years 
beginning after July 4, 2025, if the 
taxpayer is a specified foreign entity; 
and (ii) for taxable years beginning after 
July 4, 2027, if the taxpayer is a foreign- 
influenced entity (other than a foreign- 
influenced entity that made certain 
payments to a specified foreign entity). 
See section 7701(a)(51)(B) and (D) for 
definitions of the terms specified foreign 
entity and foreign-influenced entity. 
G. Specific Recordkeeping and 
Substantiation Requirements 
In addition to the general 
recordkeeping requirements under 
section 6001 and § 1.6001–1, proposed 
§ 1.45Z–4(g) would require a taxpayer 
claiming the section 45Z credit to 
maintain records sufficient to establish 
the taxpayer’s eligibility for the section 
45Z credit and the amount of the credit 
claimed. It would also provide two safe 
harbors: (i) for substantiating emissions 
rates with respect to non-SAF 
transportation fuel; and (ii) for 
substantiating qualified sales of 
transportation fuel. 
The proposed recordkeeping and 
substantiation requirements are 
necessary to ensure the accuracy of 
reported emissions rates and because 
the amount of the section 45Z credit 
may depend on certain operational 
choices, such as use of certain types of 
feedstocks or fuels, or engaging in 
certain emissions-reduction practices 
like carbon capture and sequestration 
(which may vary from year to year). 
1. In General 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4(g)(1) would 
provide that at a minimum, sufficient 
records include records: (i) establishing 
that each fuel produced is a 
transportation fuel; (ii) establishing any 
relevant information relating to the 
primary feedstock(s) used to produce 
each fuel; (iii) establishing that each fuel 
meets any additional specifications for 
the type of fuel as described in § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(24) or (30); (iv) substantiating how 
the emissions rate for each fuel was 
determined (including, if applicable, the 
specific type(s) and category(ies) under 
the applicable emissions rate table); (v) 
relating to any fuel testing obtained by 
the taxpayer; (vi) establishing that each 
facility used to produce fuel is a 
qualified facility; (vii) establishing the 
date each facility was placed in service; 
(viii) establishing that each fuel was 
sold in a qualified sale; and (ix) 
establishing any certification from an 
unrelated person and substantiating the 
information contained therein. A 
taxpayer must also keep all information, 
including raw data, used for or related 
to any petition for a PER. If a taxpayer 
is claiming an increased credit amount 
by satisfying the PWA requirements, the 
taxpayer must also maintain the records 
described in § 1.45Z–3 (referencing 
§ 1.45–12). 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4(g)(2) would 
provide a safe harbor for substantiating 
the emissions rate for a non-SAF 
transportation fuel that was determined 
using the 45ZCF–GREET model. A 
taxpayer relying on this safe harbor 
would need to obtain certification in 
substantially the same form and manner 
described in proposed § 1.45Z–5 
(related to certification for a SAF 
transportation fuel) with respect to that 
non-SAF transportation fuel. The 
proposed § 1.45Z–5 certification 
requirements are discussed in Part V. of 
this Explanation of Provisions. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–4(g)(3)(i) would 
provide a safe harbor for substantiating 
whether the sale of a transportation fuel 
is a qualified sale for purposes of 
section 45Z. A taxpayer relying on this 
safe harbor would need to obtain from 
the purchaser a certificate prepared by 
the purchaser under penalty of perjury 
in substantially the same form and 
manner as that described in proposed 
§ 1.45Z–4(g)(3)(ii). Proposed § 1.45Z– 
4(g)(3)(ii) would include a model 
certificate that a taxpayer may use for 
purposes of meeting this safe harbor. If 
the certificate relates to a single 
purchase, the taxpayer must obtain the 
certificate from the purchaser prior to or 
at the time of sale. If the certificate 
relates to purchases made over a period 
of time, the taxpayer must obtain the 
certificate from the purchaser prior to or 
at the same time as the initial sale to 
which the certificate relates. The safe 
harbor would require that a taxpayer 
have no reason to believe that any 
information in the certificate regarding 
the use of the transportation fuel is 
false. The safe harbor would also require 
a taxpayer to maintain the certificate 
with respect to the sale of transportation 
fuel in its books and records. 
Additionally, the Treasury 
Department and the IRS request 
comments on what types of 
documentation or other substantiation a 
taxpayer should maintain to establish: 
proper determination of a fuel’s 
emissions rate, including the inputs into 
CORSIA Default, CORSIA Actual, or the 
45ZCF–GREET model; certification from 
an unrelated person for non-SAF 
transportation fuel; existing systems, 
industry standards, or customary 
practices that may be used to 
substantiate emissions rate and inputs 
into CORSIA Default, CORSIA Actual, 
or the 45ZCF–GREET model (or if there 
are none, how such tracking and 
verification systems should be 
developed, with potential timelines 
regarding development). 
2. Foreign Feedstocks Including Used 
Cooking Oil 
As explained in Notice 2025–10, the 
Treasury Department and the IRS 
remain concerned about the ability to 
reliably distinguish between imported 
used cooking oil (UCO) and palm oil, 
and the resulting risk of crediting 
ineligible fuels. Furthermore, section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(ii) provides that 
transportation fuel that is produced after 
December 31, 2025, must be exclusively 
derived from a feedstock that was 
produced or grown in the United States, 
Mexico, or Canada. As previously 
discussed in Part IV.F. of this 
Explanation of Provisions, proposed 
§ 1.45Z–4(f)(1) would implement this 
statutory change. 
Consistent with this approach, 
pathways that use foreign feedstocks 
(including UCO) for fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025, will not be available 
in the 45ZCF–GREET model until the 
Treasury Department and the IRS 
publish further guidance. A feedstock is 
considered a foreign feedstock if it 
originates from a source (for example, a 
farm, restaurant, or food processor) and/ 
or is purchased from an aggregator 
located outside the United States, 
Canada, or Mexico. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
are considering appropriate 
substantiation and recordkeeping 
requirements for feedstocks imported 
from Canada and Mexico (including 
UCO), and request comments on 
possible approaches with respect to 
substantiating that any imported 
feedstocks meet the statutory sourcing 
requirement. The Treasury Department 
and the IRS are also interested in any 
industry practices to track feedstock 
source(s) that would mitigate potential 
taxpayer burden while being 
administrable for the IRS. For example, 
whether using specific existing business 
records, a taxpayer could demonstrate 
that feedstocks exclusively produced in 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5176 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
Canada or Mexico did not contain other 
feedstocks or additives that originated 
outside of Canada or Mexico. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
also request comments on purchases 
from aggregators of UCO and 
approaches to determine the underlying 
source(s) of the UCO that are 
administrable for taxpayers and the IRS. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
request comments on, for instance, 
whether there are reliable methods that 
would indicate the geographic location 
where seeds originated or crops were 
grown as a precursor for use as cooking 
oil, which could be used to determine 
whether the foreign feedstock limitation 
in section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(iii) applies. 
V. Procedures for Certification of 
Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Rates 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5 would provide 
rules for certification from an unrelated 
person of emissions rates for SAF 
transportation fuel (certification). The 
rules would describe the content, form, 
and manner of the required certification 
under section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II). 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(b) through (f) would 
provide rules relating to the content of 
the certification. Proposed § 1.45Z–5(g) 
would describe the requirements for 
timely certification. Proposed § 1.45Z– 
5(h) would provide a model 
certification. 
A. Requirements for Certifications 
1. In General 
In general, proposed § 1.45Z–5(b)(1) 
would provide that for each taxable year 
for which a taxpayer claims a section 
45Z credit for SAF transportation fuel, 
the taxpayer must obtain a certification 
from an unrelated person and include 
such certification with the taxpayer’s 
Form 7218, which is filed with the 
taxpayer’s Federal income tax return or 
Federal information return, for each 
qualified facility at which the taxpayer 
produces SAF transportation fuel. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(b)(2) would 
provide that the certification described 
in proposed § 1.45Z–5(b)(1) must be 
prepared by a qualified certifier (as 
defined in proposed § 1.45Z–5(b)(3)) 
and signed by the qualified certifier 
under penalty of perjury. Proposed 
§ 1.45Z–5(b)(2) would further provide 
that the certification must include 
information that is in substantially the 
same form as the model certification 
provided in proposed § 1.45Z–5(h). 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(b)(2)(i) through (vi) 
would describe the following 
information that a certification must 
contain: (i) a statement from the 
qualified certifier regarding the 
production of SAF transportation fuel 
(production statement); (ii) a statement 
from the qualified certifier regarding 
conflicts of interest (conflict statement); 
(iii) information regarding the qualified 
certifier, including documentation of 
the qualified certifier’s qualifications 
(qualified certifier statement); (iv) 
certain general information about the 
qualified facility at which the SAF 
transportation fuel production 
undergoing certification occurred 
(qualified facility statement); (v) any 
documentation necessary to substantiate 
the certification process given the 
standards and best practices prescribed 
by the qualified certifier’s accrediting 
body as they apply to the circumstances 
of the taxpayer and the qualified 
facility; and (vi) any other information 
or documentation required by 
applicable IRS tax forms or form 
instructions. 
2. Production Statement 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(c)(1) would 
provide that the production statement 
must state that the qualified certifier 
performed a certification sufficient for 
the IRS to determine that any lifecycle 
GHG emissions data inputs and the 
operation, during the applicable taxable 
year, of the qualified facility that 
produced the SAF transportation fuel 
for which the section 45Z credit is 
claimed are accurately reflected in: (i) 
the number of gallons of SAF 
transportation fuel produced by the 
taxpayer that is entered on the Form 
7218 with which the certification is 
included; and (ii) either the data the 
taxpayer input into the allowed 
methodology under proposed § 1.45Z– 
2(e)(3), or the data the taxpayer 
submitted in its PER petition and that 
was provided to the DOE in support of 
the taxpayer’s request for the emissions 
value provided in the PER petition. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(c)(2) would 
provide that, if a taxpayer submitted a 
PER petition, then the production 
statement must also specify the 
emissions value received from the DOE 
that was calculated using the data 
provided in support of the taxpayer’s 
emissions value request. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(c)(3) would 
provide that the production statement 
must specify the lifecycle GHG 
emissions rate and the amount of SAF 
transportation fuel produced by the 
taxpayer that are entered on the Form 
7218 with which the certification is 
included. 
3. Conflict Statement 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(d)(1) would 
provide that the conflict statement must 
state that: (i) the qualified certifier has 
not received a fee based to any extent 
on the value of any section 45Z credit 
that has been or is expected to be 
claimed by the taxpayer, and no 
arrangement has been made for such fee 
to be paid at any time in the future; (ii) 
the qualified certifier has not been a 
party to any transaction involving the 
sale of SAF transportation fuel the 
taxpayer produced or in which the 
taxpayer purchased primary feedstocks 
for the production of such SAF 
transportation fuel; (iii) the qualified 
certifier is unrelated to the taxpayer and 
is not an employee of the taxpayer; and 
(iv) the qualified certifier is not married 
to anyone who is related to, or an 
employee of, the taxpayer. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(d)(2) would 
provide that if the qualified certifier is 
acting in his or her capacity as a partner 
in a partnership, an employee of any 
person, whether an individual, 
corporation, or partnership, or an 
independent contractor engaged by a 
person other than the taxpayer, the 
statements described in proposed 
§ 1.45Z–5(d)(1) must also be made with 
respect to the partnership or the person 
that employs or engages the qualified 
certifier. 
4. Qualified Certifier Statement 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(e) would provide 
that the qualified certifier statement 
must include: (i) the qualified certifier’s 
name, address, and certifier 
identification number; (ii) the qualified 
certifier’s qualifications to conduct the 
certification, including a description of 
the certification the qualified certifier 
received from the accrediting body; (iii) 
if the qualified certifier is acting in his 
or her capacity as a partner in a 
partnership, an employee of any person, 
whether an individual, corporation, or 
partnership, or an independent 
contractor engaged by a person other 
than the taxpayer, the name, address, 
and certifier identification number of 
the partnership or the person that 
employs or engages the qualified 
certifier; (iv) the signature of the 
qualified certifier and the date of 
signature; and (v) a statement that the 
certification was conducted for Federal 
tax purposes. 
5. Information on Taxpayer’s Qualified 
Facility 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(f) would provide 
that the certification must include: (i) 
the location of the qualified facility; (ii) 
a description of the qualified facility, 
including its method of producing SAF 
transportation fuel; (iii) the type(s) of 
primary feedstock(s) used by the 
qualified facility to produce the SAF 
transportation fuel during the taxable

year of production; (iv) the amount(s) of 
primary feedstock(s) used by the 
qualified facility to produce the SAF 
transportation fuel during the taxable 
year of production; (v) the location(s) 
from which the qualified facility 
sourced the primary feedstock(s) used to 
produce the SAF transportation fuel 
during the taxable year of production; 
(vi) a list of the metering devices used 
to record any data used by the qualified 
certifier to support the production 
statement under proposed § 1.45Z–5(c), 
along with a statement that the qualified 
certifier has reason to believe that the 
device(s) underwent industry- 
appropriate quality assurance and 
quality control, and the accuracy and 
calibration of the device has been tested 
in the year prior to the time of 
observation; and (vii) confirmation that 
the emissions rate of the SAF 
transportation fuel produced during the 
taxable year of production is accurate to 
the higher of +/¥5% or 2 kilograms of 
CO
2e per mmBTU. 
B. Qualified Certifier 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(b)(3) would 
provide rules regarding qualified 
certifiers for the allowed methodologies. 
A qualified certifier would be required 
to have the relevant active accreditation 
as of the date it provides a certification 
to a taxpayer. 
1. CORSIA Methodologies 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(b)(3)(i) would 
provide that, for taxpayers using 
CORSIA Default or CORSIA Actual to 
determine the emissions rate for SAF 
transportation fuel, the term qualified 
certifier means any individual or 
organization that is unrelated to the 
taxpayer and is not an employee of the 
taxpayer, and that has an active 
accreditation from International 
Sustainability and Carbon Certification, 
Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, 
ClassNK, or other sustainability 
certification scheme approved by ICAO. 
Such individuals or organizations are 
experienced and familiar with 
evaluating information regarding 
CORSIA Default and CORSIA Actual. 
2. 45ZCF–GREET Model 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(b)(3)(ii) would 
provide that, for taxpayers using the 
45ZCF–GREET model to determine the 
emissions for SAF transportation fuel, 
the term qualified certifier means any 
individual or organization that is 
unrelated to the taxpayer and is not an 
employee of the taxpayer, and that has 
an active accreditation from: (i) the 
American National Standards Institute 
National Accreditation Board (ANAB) to 
conduct validation and verification in 
accordance with the requirements of 
International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) 14065; or (ii) as a 
verifier, lead verifier, or verification 
body under the California Air Resources 
Board Low Carbon Fuel Standard 
(CARB LCFS) program. Such ANAB and 
CARB LCFS verifiers are experienced 
with evaluating information similar to 
the information included in the 45ZCF– 
GREET model. 
C. Timely Certification Required 
Proposed § 1.45Z–5(g) would provide 
that a certification that includes all 
required information is valid with 
respect to a particular claim only if it is 
signed and dated by the qualified 
certifier no later than: (i) the due date, 
including extensions, of the Federal 
income tax return or Federal 
information return for the taxable year 
during which the SAF transportation 
fuel undergoing certification is sold in 
a qualified sale; or (ii) in the case of a 
section 45Z credit first claimed for the 
taxable year on an amended return or 
administrative adjustment request 
(AAR), the date on which the amended 
return or AAR is filed. 
VI. Procedures for Filing a Claim for 
the Clean Fuel Production Credit 
Proposed § 1.45Z–6 would describe 
the time and manner of filing a claim for 
the section 45Z credit and provide 
special rules for cases in which the 
taxpayer claiming the credit is not the 
registered producer of a transportation 
fuel. Under the proposed rule, a 
taxpayer claiming a section 45Z credit 
would either be the person registered as 
a producer of a transportation fuel at the 
time of production, or a person that 
would be treated as the registrant. 
A. Time and Manner of Filing a Claim 
In general, proposed § 1.45Z–6(a) 
would provide that a taxpayer claims 
the section 45Z credit on a completed 
Form 7218 included with the taxpayer’s 
timely filed (including extensions) 
Federal income tax return or Federal 
information return for the taxable year 
for which the taxpayer claims the 
section 45Z credit. Under proposed 
§ 1.45Z–6(a), a taxpayer would need to 
complete a separate Form 7218 for each 
qualified facility at which it produces a 
transportation fuel for which it is 
claiming a credit. 
B. Proper Claimant 
Proposed § 1.45Z–6(b)(1) would 
provide the general rule that only a 
taxpayer that is registered by the IRS as 
a producer of transportation fuel at the 
time of production may claim the 
section 45Z credit. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–6(b)(2)(i) through 
(iii) would provide special rules for 
situations in which a person other than 
a registered producer of transportation 
fuel may claim the section 45Z credit. 
These special rules would generally 
apply to: (i) a taxpayer that owns an 
entity that is disregarded as an entity 
separate from its owner, as defined in 
§ 301.7701–2(c)(2)(i) (disregarded 
entity); (ii) an S corporation (as defined 
in section 1361(a)(1)) that owns a 
qualified subchapter S subsidiary 
(QSub), as defined in section 
1361(b)(3)(B); and (iii) an agent for a 
consolidated group, as defined in 
§ 1.1502–77. The proposed rules are 
consistent with the section 45Z Fact 
Sheet FAQs but provide additional 
specificity and clarity. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–6(b)(2)(i) would 
provide that in the case of a disregarded 
entity that produces transportation fuel 
and is registered as a producer of 
transportation fuel at the time of 
production, the taxpayer that owns the 
disregarded entity is treated as the 
registered producer for purposes of 
claiming the section 45Z credit. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–6(b)(2)(ii) would 
provide that in the case of a QSub that 
produces transportation fuel and is 
registered as a producer of 
transportation fuel at the time of 
production, the S corporation that owns 
the QSub is treated as the registered 
producer for purposes of claiming the 
section 45Z credit. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–6(b)(2)(iii) would 
clarify that if a member of a 
consolidated group is registered as a 
producer of transportation fuel at the 
time of production, the agent for such 
consolidated group is treated as the 
registered producer for purposes of 
claiming the section 45Z credit. 
VII. Section 4101 Registration 
A. Section 4101 Registration Generally 
Proposed § 1.4101–1 would provide 
rules for section 4101 registration for 
purposes of section 45Z, including rules 
addressing disregarded entities, QSubs, 
and members of a consolidated group, 
and the registration tests for purposes of 
section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I). The proposed 
rules are modeled after the longstanding 
registration rules in § 48.4101–1 of the 
Manufacturers and Retailers Excise Tax 
Regulations that apply for purposes of 
fuel excise taxes and credits. This 
registration requirement is distinct from 
the required pre-filing registration for a 
taxpayer that intends to make a section 
6417 or section 6418 election, as 
provided by the Credit Transfer Election 
Regulations and the Elective Payment 
Election Regulations.

5178 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
Proposed §§ 1.4101–1(a)(4) and 
48.4101–1(a)(8) would provide rules for 
reregistration. Proposed §§ 1.4101–1(h) 
and 48.4101(a)(7) would provide rules 
regarding the effect of a Letter of 
Registration for purposes of section 45Z 
and excise tax registrations, 
respectively. 
Proposed § 1.4101–1 would provide 
rules regarding the approval, denial, 
revocation, or suspension of registration 
that are similar to the rules of section 
4222(c) and § 48.4222(c)–1. 
Additionally, many of the requirements 
of proposed § 1.4101–1 would be similar 
or identical to the existing provisions of 
§ 48.4101–1 and to proposed § 48.4101– 
1(a)(7) and (8), which would facilitate 
consistent tax administration. The 
Treasury Department and the IRS are 
aware that many applicants for 
registration for purposes of the section 
45Z credit and other income tax credits 
must also be registered under section 
4101 for excise tax purposes. As a 
result, many applicants are already 
familiar with the section 4101 
registration process and must maintain 
other section 4101 registrations (in 
addition to the registration required 
under section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) and other 
income tax registrations). 
B. Letter of Registration Required 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(a)(2) would 
provide that a person is registered under 
section 4101 only if the IRS has issued 
that person a Letter of Registration 
under the appropriate activity letter and 
the registration has not been revoked or 
suspended. This proposed rule is 
similar to § 48.4101–1(a)(2). 
C. Separate Entity Treatment 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(a)(3)(i) would 
provide that each business unit that has, 
or is required to have, a separate EIN is 
treated as a separate person for purposes 
of registration. Proposed § 1.4101– 
1(a)(3)(ii) would provide that 
§ 301.7701–2(c)(2)(i) (disregarded entity 
treatment for certain wholly owned 
entities) does not apply for purposes of 
registration under proposed § 1.4101–1. 
Under the proposed rule, a disregarded 
entity that has, or is required to have, 
an EIN would be treated as a 
corporation for purposes of registration. 
Therefore, under the proposed rule, if 
such an entity produces transportation 
fuel, it must be registered as a producer 
of transportation fuel at the time of 
production for the owner of the 
disregarded entity to be eligible to claim 
the section 45Z credit for such fuel. 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(a)(3)(iii) would 
provide that a QSub is treated as a 
separate corporation for purposes of 
registration under proposed § 1.4101–1. 
As a consequence, each QSub that has 
an EIN and that produces transportation 
fuel must be registered as a producer of 
transportation fuel at the time of 
production for its S corporation owner 
to be eligible to claim the section 45Z 
credit for such fuel. For consistency and 
clarity, the proposed regulations would 
also amend the introductory clause of 
§ 1.1361–4(a)(1) (which generally 
ignores a QSub’s separate existence for 
Federal tax purposes) by adding 
proposed § 1.4101–1(a)(3)(iii) to the list 
of exceptions. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
understand that many facilities that 
produce transportation fuel are owned 
by a disregarded entity. The proposed 
regulations would provide registration 
rules that would reflect this practice 
while also satisfying the statutory 
requirements. The proposed rules 
would be similar to and consistent with: 
(i) § 48.4101–1(a)(4), which provides 
that every business that has, or is 
required to have, a separate EIN is 
treated as a separate person for purposes 
of excise tax registration under section 
4101; (ii) § 301.7701–2(c)(2)(v)(A)(3), 
which provides that § 301.7701– 
2(c)(2)(i) (concerning certain wholly- 
owned entities) does not apply for 
purposes of registration under sections 
4101, 4222, and 4412; and (iii) § 1.1361– 
4(a)(8)(i)(C), which provides that a QSub 
is treated as a separate corporation for 
purposes of registration under sections 
4101, 4222, and 4412. 
The separate entity rules would also 
align with other related tax provisions, 
including sections 45V and 45Q (for 
which anti-stacking provisions apply), 
and the elective payment and credit 
transfer election provisions of sections 
6417 and 6418, which elections are 
generally made on a per-facility basis. 
Although the proposed rules are 
consistent with the making of a section 
6417 or section 6418 election on a 
facility-by-facility basis, it is important 
to highlight the difference between 
these proposed registration rules and 
the rules for making an election under 
section 6417 or section 6418. 
With respect to sections 6417 and 
6418, if a taxpayer is the sole owner 
(directly or indirectly) of a disregarded 
entity for Federal income tax purposes 
and the disregarded entity directly 
holds the underlying applicable credit 
property, then the taxpayer (and not the 
disregarded entity) makes the section 
6417 or section 6418 election, including 
completing the required pre-filing 
registration as part of making a section 
6417 or section 6418 election. See 
§§ 1.6417–2(a)(1)(ii), 1.6417–5, 1.6418– 
2(a)(3)(i), and 1.6418–4. For example, if 
a taxpayer has two qualified facilities 
for purposes of section 45Z that are 
owned by separate disregarded entities, 
each disregarded entity (and not the 
taxpayer) must be registered as a 
producer of transportation fuel for 
purposes of the section 45Z credit. 
However, the taxpayer (and not either 
disregarded entity) would ultimately 
make any section 6417 or section 6418 
election (including completing the 
section 6417 or section 6418 pre-filing 
registration process) with respect to any 
section 45Z credit determined with 
respect to each qualified facility. 
Additionally, section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) 
requires registration ‘‘under section 
4101.’’ This language indicates that 
Congress meant for the existing 
§ 48.4101–1 regulations to apply for 
purposes of the section 45Z credit, 
including the separate entity rules of 
§ 48.4101–1(a)(4). The special 
procedures that apply with respect to a 
taxpayer that owns a disregarded entity 
or a QSub that is registered under 
proposed § 1.4101–1 and claims the 
section 45Z credit are discussed in Part 
VI.B. of this Explanation of Provisions. 
D. Reregistration 
As provided in section 4101(a)(5), 
proposed §§ 1.4101–1(a)(4)(i) and 
48.4101–1(a)(8)(i) would each require a 
person to reregister if after a transaction 
(or series of related transactions) more 
than 50 percent of ownership interests 
in, or assets of, such person are held by 
persons other than persons (or persons 
related thereto) who held more than 50 
percent of such interests or assets before 
the transaction (or series of related 
transactions). Reregistration would not 
apply to companies whose stock is 
regularly traded on an established 
securities market. These proposed 
requirements would be consistent with 
section 4101(a)(5) and (d). 
Proposed §§ 1.4101–1(a)(4)(ii) and 
48.4101–1(a)(8)(ii) would each require a 
person to reregister if the person 
changes its EIN. 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(a)(4)(iii) would 
provide a safe harbor for a person that 
has been registered by the IRS and must 
reregister due to a change in ownership 
or EIN. A person that is approved for 
reregistration would be eligible to claim 
a section 45Z credit as of the date the 
IRS received the application for 
reregistration, even if, at the time of 
such person’s fuel production, the IRS 
had not yet approved the reregistration. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
recognize the urgency for a taxpayer to 
be issued a Letter of Registration for 
purposes of the section 45Z credit 
because, unlike other tax credits 
requiring section 4101 registration, 
section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) requires that a

taxpayer be registered at the time of 
production. 
E. Definitions 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(b)(1) would 
define an ‘‘applicant’’ as a person that 
has applied for registration under 
proposed § 1.4101–1(d). The proposed 
definition is consistent with the 
definition of ‘‘applicant’’ in § 48.4101– 
1(b)(1). 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(b)(2) would 
define ‘‘Letter of Registration’’ as a letter 
issued by the IRS to approve a 
registration required under section 
4101. Under the proposed definition, a 
Letter of Registration would include the 
registrant’s registration number and the 
effective date of the registration. 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(b)(3) would 
define the phrase ‘‘penalized for a 
wrongful act’’ as cases in which a 
person has: (i) been assessed any 
penalty under chapter 68 of the Code (or 
similar provision of the law of any 
State) for fraudulently failing to file any 
return or pay any tax, and the penalty 
has not been wholly abated, refunded, 
or credited; (ii) been assessed any 
penalty under chapter 68 of the Code, 
such penalty has not been wholly 
abated, refunded, or credited, and the 
IRS determines that the conduct 
resulting in the penalty is part of a 
consistent pattern of failing to deposit, 
pay, or pay over a substantial amount of 
tax; (iii) been convicted of a crime under 
chapter 75 of the Code (or similar 
provision of the law of any State), or of 
conspiracy to commit such a crime, and 
the conviction has not been wholly 
reversed by a court of competent 
jurisdiction; (iv) been convicted, under 
the laws of the United States or any 
State, of a felony for which an element 
of the offense is theft, fraud, or the 
making of false statements, and the 
conviction has not been wholly reversed 
by a court of competent jurisdiction; (v) 
been assessed any tax under section 
4103 of the Code and the tax has not 
been wholly abated, refunded, or 
credited; or (vi) had its registration 
under section 4101, section 4222, 
section 4662, or section 4682 of the 
Code revoked. This proposed definition 
is similar to the definition of the phrase 
‘‘penalized for a wrongful act’’ in 
§ 48.4101–1(b)(4). 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(b)(4) would 
define a ‘‘related person’’ for purposes 
of registration under section 4101 as a 
person that: (i) directly or indirectly 
exercises control over an activity of the 
applicant; (ii) owns, directly or 
indirectly, five percent or more of the 
applicant; (iii) is under a duty to assure 
the payment of a tax for which the 
applicant is responsible; (iv) is a 
member, with the applicant, of a group 
of organizations (as defined in § 1.52– 
1(b) of this chapter) that would be 
treated as a group of trades or 
businesses under common control for 
purposes of § 1.52–1; or (v) distributed 
or transferred assets to the applicant in 
a transaction in which the applicant’s 
basis in the assets is determined by 
reference to the basis of the assets in the 
hands of the distributor or transferor. 
This proposed definition is consistent 
with the definition of ‘‘related person’’ 
in § 48.4101–1(b)(5). 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(b)(5) would 
define a ‘‘registrant’’ as a person who 
has registered under section 4101 in 
accordance with proposed § 1.4101– 
1(f)(3) and whose registration has not 
been revoked or suspended. This 
proposed definition is consistent with 
the definition of ‘‘registrant’’ in 
§ 48.4101–1(b)(6). 
F. Requirement To Register 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(c)(1) would 
require every person producing a 
transportation fuel, as defined in 
proposed § 1.45Z–1(b)(34), to register 
with the IRS in accordance with 
proposed § 1.4101–1. The proposed rule 
incorporates the registration 
requirement described in section 
4101(a)(1), as amended by section 
70521(i) of the OBBBA, and is similar to 
§ 48.4101–1(c)(1). The proposed rule is 
also consistent with section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I). 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(c)(2) would 
articulate the consequences of failing to 
register under section 4101 by citing to 
penalties under sections 6719, 7232, 
and 7272 of the Code. The proposed 
rule is similar to § 48.4101–1(c)(3), 
which was published before the 
enactment of section 6719 and cites to 
penalties under sections 7232 and 7272. 
Section 7232 imposes a criminal penalty 
for failure to register or reregister as 
required by section 4101 or for a willful 
false statement in an application for 
registration or reregistration. Sections 
6719 and 7272 impose civil penalties for 
failure to register or reregister under 
section 4101. 
G. Application Instructions 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(d) would require 
applicants to apply for section 4101 
registration using Form 637, 
Application for Registration (For Certain 
Excise Tax Activities), or such other 
form as the IRS may designate, in 
accordance with the instructions to such 
form. An applicant would be required to 
apply for registration under activity 
letter CN if seeking registration as a 
producer of non-SAF transportation 
fuel, and under activity letter CA if 
seeking registration as a producer of 
SAF transportation fuel, or under such 
other activity letter(s) as the IRS may 
designate. The proposed rule is 
consistent with §§ 48.4101–1(e) and 
48.4222(a)–1(b). 
H. Registration Tests 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(e)(1) would 
provide that the IRS will register an 
applicant only if the applicant meets the 
activity test of proposed § 1.4101– 
1(e)(2), the acceptable risk test of 
proposed § 1.4101–1(e)(3), and the 
satisfactory tax history test of proposed 
§ 1.4101–1(e)(4), which are collectively 
called the ‘‘registration tests.’’ The 
registration tests under proposed 
§ 1.4101–1(e) are similar to the 
registration tests under § 48.4101–1(f). 
The proposed registration tests are 
consistent with sections 4101(c) and 
4222(c), because their purposes are to 
confirm whether an applicant is actually 
engaging in the activity for which it is 
requesting to be registered, to prevent an 
applicant from becoming registered and 
being able to claim a tax credit if it is 
not engaged in such an activity, and to 
ensure that an applicant has satisfied all 
of its tax obligations under the Code, 
similar to section 4222(c) and 
§§ 48.4222(a)–1 and 48.4222(c)–1. These 
tests are necessary to protect the 
revenue and to prevent applicants from 
using their registration to avoid 
payment of tax (by erroneously claiming 
an income tax credit). 
1. Activity Test 
Under proposed § 1.4101–1(e)(2), an 
applicant would meet the activity test 
only if the IRS determines that the 
applicant: (i) is, in the course of its trade 
or business, regularly engaged in the 
activity for which it is requesting 
registration; or (ii) is likely to be 
(because of such factors as the 
applicant’s business experience, 
financial standing, or trade 
connections), in the course of its trade 
or business, regularly engaged in the 
activity for which it is requesting 
registration within 6 months after 
becoming registered under section 4101. 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(e)(2) is similar to 
§ 48.4101–1(f)(2). 
The purpose of the activity test is to 
prevent applicants that are not engaged 
in the activity required for the section 
45Z credit from becoming registered 
under section 4101, which is a 
prerequisite to claiming the section 45Z 
credit. For example, if an applicant 
seeking registration for purposes of the 
section 45Z credit represents on its 
application for registration that it is not 
yet (or likely to be within 6 months) 
engaged in the activity of producing a

5180 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
transportation fuel, such applicant 
would not be approved for registration 
because it fails the activity test. 
2. Acceptable Risk Test 
Under proposed § 1.4101–1(e)(3)(i), an 
applicant would meet the acceptable 
risk test only if neither the applicant nor 
a related person (as defined in proposed 
§ 1.4101–1(b)(4)) has been penalized for 
a wrongful act. Additionally, if an 
applicant or a related person has been 
penalized for a wrongful act, the IRS 
would be able to determine that an 
applicant meets the acceptable risk test 
based on consideration of the factors 
enumerated in proposed § 1.4101– 
1(e)(3)(ii). The acceptable risk test under 
proposed § 1.4101–1(e)(3) is similar to 
the acceptable risk test under § 48.4101– 
1(f)(3). 
The purpose of the acceptable risk test 
under proposed § 1.4101–1(e)(3) is to 
ensure that the applicant and persons 
related to the applicant have met their 
obligations to pay taxes and file returns 
under the Code and also have not been 
convicted of a crime that indicates that 
the applicant would be dishonest in its 
representations to the IRS for purposes 
of protecting the revenue, similar to 
section 4222(c). 
3. Satisfactory Tax History Test 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(e)(4)(i) would 
provide that an applicant meets the 
satisfactory tax history only if the IRS 
determines that the applicant has a 
satisfactory tax history. Proposed 
§ 1.4101–1(e)(4)(ii) would provide that 
an applicant has a satisfactory tax 
history only if the IRS determines that 
the filing, deposit, and payment history 
for all Federal taxes of the applicant and 
any related person (as defined in 
proposed § 1.4101–1(b)(4)) supports the 
conclusion that the applicant will 
comply with its obligations under 
proposed § 1.4101–1. Proposed 
§ 1.4101–1(e)(4) is similar to the 
adequate security test of § 48.4101– 
1(f)(4), and the definition of 
‘‘satisfactory tax history’’ in proposed 
§ 1.4101–1(e)(4)(ii) is similar to the 
definition in § 48.4101–1(f)(4)(iii). 
The purpose of the satisfactory tax 
history test under proposed § 1.4101– 
1(e)(4) is to ensure that the applicant 
and persons related to the applicant 
have met their obligations to pay taxes 
and file returns under the Code and also 
have not been convicted of a crime that 
indicates that the applicant would be 
dishonest in its representations to the 
IRS for purposes of protecting the 
revenue, similar to section 4222(c). 
I. Action on Application by the IRS 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(f)(1) would 
provide that the IRS may investigate the 
accuracy and completeness of any 
representations made by an applicant 
and request any additional relevant 
information from the applicant. 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(f)(2) would 
provide that if the IRS determines that 
an applicant does not meet all the 
registration tests described in proposed 
§ 1.4101–1(e), the IRS will notify the 
applicant, in writing, that its application 
for registration is denied and state the 
basis for the denial. Proposed § 1.4101– 
1(f)(3) would provide that if the IRS 
determines that an applicant meets all 
the registration tests described in 
proposed § 1.4101–1(e), the IRS will 
register the applicant under section 
4101 and issue the applicant a Letter of 
Registration that includes the effective 
date of the registration and the 
appropriate activity letter(s). The 
proposed rule would also provide that 
a copy of an application for registration 
(Form 637) is not a Letter of 
Registration. Proposed § 1.4101–1(f) is 
similar to § 48.4101–1(g). 
J. Terms and Conditions of Registration 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(g)(1) would 
require each applicant or registrant to: 
(i) make deposits, file returns, and pay 
taxes required by the Code and the 
regulations; (ii) keep records sufficient 
to show production of a transportation 
fuel; and (iii) notify the IRS of any 
change (such as a change in ownership) 
in the information the registrant 
submitted in connection with its 
application for registration or previously 
submitted under proposed § 1.4101– 
1(g)(1)(iii), within 10 days after the 
change occurs. Proposed § 1.4101– 
1(g)(1) is similar to § 48.4101–1(h)(1). 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(g)(2) would 
provide that an applicant or registrant 
may not sell, lease, or otherwise allow 
another person to use its registration 
(except as otherwise provided in 
proposed § 1.45Z–6(b)(2)) or make any 
false statement to the IRS in connection 
with a submission under section 4101. 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(g)(2) is similar to 
§ 48.4101–1(h)(2). 
Requiring registrants to comply with 
their tax deposits, payments, and filing 
burdens under the Code protects the 
revenue, similar to section 4222(c) and 
§ 48.4222(c)–1. Requiring registrants to 
notify the IRS of any change in 
information that the registrant 
submitted in connection with its 
application ensures the IRS is aware of 
relevant changes and can ensure the 
registrant continues to be eligible to 
retain its registration. 
For example, if a registrant that 
produces a transportation fuel changes 
the type of fuel it produces, the 
registrant should inform the IRS of this 
change so that the IRS can review the 
fuel being produced to ensure that the 
registrant still meets a condition of 
registration by producing a 
transportation fuel. Prohibiting a 
registrant from allowing another person 
to use its registration and make false 
statements to the IRS ensures that the 
IRS can rely upon the information and 
representations provided by a registrant, 
and protects the revenue by preventing 
fraud and abuse of section 4101 
registration. 
K. Effect of Letter of Registration 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(h) and proposed 
§ 48.4101–1(a)(7) would provide that a 
Letter of Registration is not a 
determination of liability for tax, 
eligibility for a tax credit or deduction, 
or any other tax treatment under the 
Code. The proposed rules would also 
provide that a Letter of Registration is 
not a determination letter, as defined in 
§ 601.201(a)(3) of this chapter. 
The proposed rules are consistent 
with section 4101 and the overall 
statutory scheme. Section 4101 
addresses only registration and not 
eligibility for underlying tax credits for 
which registration is required. 
Additionally, for each tax credit that 
requires registration under section 4101, 
registration is one of multiple 
requirements for credit eligibility. A 
taxpayer must meet all of the statutory 
requirements for each credit and cannot 
rely solely on a Letter of Registration to 
prove entitlement to such credit because 
doing so would make the other 
requirements in the tax credit statutes 
superfluous. See, e.g., sections 
40(b)(6)(E), 40A, 40B, 45Z, and 6426(k). 
Additionally, in the case of excise tax 
credits, courts have held that a Letter of 
Registration indicates only that the 
registrant is registered under section 
4101 and is not a determination that the 
registrant is entitled to claim such 
credit. See Affordable Bio Feedstock, 
Inc. v. United States, 529 F. Supp. 3d 
1298, 1304–07 (M.D. Fla. 2021), aff’d, 42 
F.4th 1288 (11th Cir. 2022). 
L. Adverse Actions by the IRS Against 
a Registrant 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(i)(1) would 
provide that the IRS will revoke or 
suspend a registration if the IRS 
determines at any time that the 
registrant: (i) does not meet one or more 
of the registration tests under proposed 
§ 1.4101–1(e) and has not corrected the 
deficiency within a reasonable period of 
time after notification by the IRS; (ii) 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5181 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
has used its registration to evade, or 
attempt to evade, the payment of any 
tax, or to postpone or in any manner to 
interfere with the collection of any such 
tax, or to make a fraudulent claim for a 
credit or payment; (iii) has aided or 
abetted another person in evading, or 
attempting to evade, payment of any tax, 
or in making a fraudulent claim for a 
credit or payment; or (iv) has sold, 
leased, or otherwise allowed another 
person to use its registration, except as 
otherwise provided in proposed 
§ 1.45Z–6(b)(2). 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(i)(2) would 
provide that if the IRS determines that 
a registrant has, at any time, failed to 
comply with the terms and conditions 
of registration under proposed § 1.4101– 
1(g), made a false statement to the IRS 
in connection with its application for 
registration (or reregistration) or for 
retention of registration, or otherwise 
used its registration in a manner that 
creates a significant risk of nonpayment 
or late payment of tax, then the IRS may 
revoke or suspend the registrant’s 
registration. 
Proposed § 1.4101–1(i)(3) would 
provide that if the IRS revokes or 
suspends a registration, the IRS will 
notify the registrant in writing and state 
the basis for the revocation or 
suspension and the activity letter(s) to 
which the revocation or suspension 
relates. The effective date of the 
revocation or suspension may not be 
earlier than the date on which the IRS 
notifies the registrant. 
These proposed rules, which are 
similar to the rules of § 48.4101–1(i), are 
necessary because they enable the IRS to 
revoke or suspend registrations as 
needed to prevent registrants that 
violate the rules of section 4101 from 
using their registration to avoid 
payment of tax (by erroneously claiming 
an income tax credit). 
VIII. Ownership Clarification for 
Section 6417 Elective Payment Election 
and Section 6418 Credit Transfer 
Election 
Both sections 6417(a) and 6418(a) 
require a credit (applicable credit or 
eligible credit) to be determined with 
respect to the taxpayer before an 
election may be made. The underlying 
credit provisions confirm whether a 
taxpayer, to determine a credit, must 
own the relevant underlying eligible 
credit property or only conduct the 
activities giving rise to a credit. Current 
§§ 1.6417–2(c)(4) and 1.6418–2(d)(1) 
provide rules on determining the credit 
with respect to a taxpayer and include 
that a credit is determined with respect 
to a taxpayer if the taxpayer owns the 
underlying eligible credit property and 
conducts the activities giving rise to the 
credit, or in the case of section 45X 
(under which ownership of eligible 
credit property is not required), is 
considered (under the regulations under 
section 45X) the taxpayer with respect 
to which the section 45X credit is 
determined. 
The preambles to the Elective 
Payment Election Regulations and the 
Credit Transfer Election Regulations 
both explain with respect to §§ 1.6417– 
2(c)(4) and 1.6418–2(d)(1), respectively, 
that the only credit for which ownership 
is not required is the section 45X credit. 
However, a taxpayer also is not required 
to own the underlying eligible credit 
property to determine the section 45Z 
credit. Section 45Z requires only that a 
taxpayer produce transportation fuel at 
a qualified facility and sell the fuel in 
a qualified sale, without requiring 
ownership of the qualified facility. See 
section 45Z(a)(1), regarding general 
credit eligibility, and section 45Z(d)(4), 
defining ‘‘qualified facility.’’ 
The proposed regulations would 
amend both §§ 1.6417–2(c)(4) and 
1.6418–2(d)(1) to indicate that facility 
ownership is not required for the 
section 45Z credit. The proposed 
amendments would only require a 
taxpayer to conduct the activities giving 
rise to the section 45Z credit. It would 
be consistent with proposed § 1.45Z– 
4(e)(1), which would state that facility 
ownership is not required for a section 
45Z credit to be determined. The 
proposed amendments would also 
clarify that ownership is not required 
for the section 45(d)(3)(C) credit and 
include clarifying language to 
acknowledge contract manufacturing 
arrangements for the section 45X credit. 
In addition, the proposed regulations 
would amend both §§ 1.6417–2(f) and 
1.6418–2(g) to provide different 
applicability dates for the proposed 
changes. The Treasury Department and 
the IRS request comments on the 
ownership language with respect to 
sections 45Z and 45(d)(3)(C), and 
whether to add language on contract 
manufacturing or toll processing 
arrangements for the section 45Z credit. 
IX. Proposed Applicability Dates and 
Reliance 
Proposed §§ 1.45Z–1, 1.45Z–2 (except 
for paragraph (e)), and 1.45Z–4 through 
1.45Z–6, would apply to qualified sales 
occurring in taxable years ending on or 
after the date the final regulations are 
published in the Federal Register. 
Proposed § 1.45Z–2(e) would apply to 
qualified sales occurring in taxable 
years ending on or after January 10, 
2025. Proposed § 1.4101–1 and 
proposed § 48.4101–1(a)(7) and (8) 
would apply to persons producing 
transportation fuel in taxable years 
ending on or after the date the final 
regulations are published in the Federal 
Register. Proposed § 1.6417–2(c)(4) and 
(f), proposed § 1.6418–2(d)(1) and (g), 
and the proposed amendment to 
§ 1.1361–4(a)(1) would apply to taxable 
years ending on or after the date the 
final regulations are published in the 
Federal Register. Taxpayers may rely on 
these proposed regulations until final 
regulations are published in the Federal 
Register, provided taxpayers follow 
them in their entirety and in a 
consistent manner. 
Special Analyses 
I. Regulatory Planning and Review 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes the importance of 
quantifying both costs and benefits, of 
reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, 
and of promoting flexibility. 
These proposed regulations have been 
designated by the Office of Management 
and Budget’s (OMB) Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA) as subject to review under 
Executive Order 12866 pursuant to the 
Memorandum of Agreement (July 4, 
2025) between the Treasury Department 
and OMB regarding review of tax 
regulations. OIRA has determined that 
this proposed rulemaking is 
economically significant and subject to 
review under section 3(f) of Executive 
Order 12866 and section 1(c) of the 
Memorandum of Agreement. 
Accordingly, these proposed regulations 
have been reviewed by OMB. 
A. Need for Regulations 
Section 45Z of the Internal Revenue 
Code provides an income tax credit for 
the production of clean transportation 
fuel, which is divided into two broad 
categories: sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF) and non-SAF transportation fuel. 
The statute directs the Secretary of the 
Treasury or the Secretary’s delegate 
(Secretary) to issue guidance regarding 
implementation of section 45Z, 
including the calculation of emissions 
rates and the annual publication of an 
emissions rate table. A taxpayer 
determines a transportation fuel’s 
emissions rate by either using the 
annual emissions rate table or obtaining 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5182 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
a provisional emissions rate (PER) 
determination from the Secretary. The 
proposed regulations provide 
procedures for taxpayers to obtain a PER 
if the emissions rate table does not 
establish an emissions rate for the type 
and category of transportation fuel 
produced. The statute also authorizes 
the Secretary to issue guidance on 
taxpayer registration and certification 
for purposes of the section 45Z credit. 
The proposed regulations also clarify 
the meaning of several statutory terms, 
such as ‘‘gallon equivalent,’’ ‘‘suitable 
for use,’’ and ‘‘sold for use in a trade or 
business.’’ 
Pursuant to section 6(a)(3)(B) of 
Executive Order 12866, the following 
qualitative analysis provides further 
details regarding the anticipated 
impacts of the proposed regulations. 
The statute, prior guidance, and 
proposed regulations are briefly 
summarized in Part I.B. of this Special 
Analyses. The economic analysis of 
these proposed regulations is described 
in Part I.C. of this Special Analyses. 
Specifically, Part I.C.1. explains the 
baseline used for the economic analysis; 
Part I.C.2. discusses the types of entities 
affected by the proposed regulations; 
and Part I.C.3. provides the qualitative 
assessment of the potential economic 
effects, including the benefits and costs, 
of the proposed regulations compared to 
the baseline. 
B. Statute, Prior Guidance, and 
Proposed Regulations 
Section 45Z provides an income tax 
credit for clean transportation fuel 
produced domestically after December 
31, 2024, and sold by December 31, 
2029. Originally enacted in 2022 and 
extended and modified by Public Law 
119–21, 139 Stat. 72 (July 4, 2025), 
commonly known as the One, Big, 
Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the section 
45Z credit replaces an assortment of 
prior fuel incentives. Those incentives 
consisted of income tax credit, excise 
tax credit, and excise tax payment 
provisions for various biofuels and other 
alternative fuels sold for use as a fuel or 
used as a fuel, including biodiesel, 
renewable diesel, compressed natural 
gas, second generation biofuel, and SAF. 
Transportation fuel is divided into two 
broad categories: SAF and non-SAF. 
Transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025, must be exclusively 
derived from a feedstock that was 
produced or grown in the United States, 
Mexico, or Canada. 
Following the statute, a taxpayer 
calculates the amount of the section 45Z 
credit by multiplying the applicable 
amount per gallon or gallon equivalent 
with respect to a transportation fuel by 
the emissions factor for that fuel. If a 
taxpayer produces the transportation 
fuel at a qualified facility that satisfies 
the prevailing wage and apprenticeship 
(PWA) requirements, the applicable 
amount is increased. A transportation 
fuel’s emissions factor measures the 
reduction in a fuel’s emissions rate 
relative to the statutory baseline 
emission rate, expressed as a fraction of 
the statutory baseline emission rate. The 
amount of the section 45Z credit is 
generally larger as the emissions rate of 
the transportation fuel approaches zero. 
Transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025, cannot have an 
emissions rate of less than zero unless 
it is derived from animal manure. 
The primary method for determining 
the emissions rate for non-SAF is the 
United States Department of Energy’s 
(DOE) 45ZCF–GREET model. Producers 
of SAF have the option of using the 
45ZCF–GREET model, the CORSIA 
Default methodology, or the CORSIA 
Actual methodology. Taxpayers can 
request a PER determination if the 
annually published emissions rate table 
does not establish an emissions rate for 
the type and category of transportation 
fuel produced. In January 2025, the 
United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) published a beta version of 
USDA Feedstock Carbon Intensity 
Calculator (FD–CIC) for testing, peer 
review, and public comment in 
preparation of a final version of USDA 
FD–CIC. Following publication of the 
final version of USDA FD–CIC, the 
Treasury Department anticipates that 
45ZCF FD–CIC, a section 45Z-specific 
version of the FD–CIC module, will be 
included as an input to the DOE’s 
45ZCF–GREET model to be used for 
calculating carbon intensity adjustments 
under section 45Z for feedstocks that are 
produced using certain agricultural 
practices. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
have issued several notices providing 
initial guidance on the section 45Z 
credit. Notice 2024–49 provided 
guidance on the section 45Z registration 
requirements, including the time, form, 
and manner of registration. Notice 
2025–10 announced forthcoming 
proposed regulations addressing the 
section 45Z credit. These proposed 
regulations are the forthcoming 
proposed regulations announced in 
Notice 2025–10. Additionally, Notice 
2025–11 provided guidance regarding 
methodologies for determining 
emissions rates under section 45Z and 
provided the initial emissions rate table. 
The proposed regulations provide 
definitions and general rules on the 
section 45Z credit, such as on credit 
eligibility, credit amount, credit timing, 
and emissions rates. The statute directs 
taxpayers to use a gallon equivalent for 
non-liquid fuels but does not provide a 
baseline standard. The proposed rules 
define ‘‘gallon equivalent’’ to mean, 
with respect to any non-liquid fuel, the 
amount of such fuel that has the energy 
equivalent of a gallon of gasoline 
determined at the lower heating value. 
The higher heating value and lower 
heating value of a fuel refer to the 
amount of energy released during 
combustion, but they differ in how they 
account for the water produced. The 
higher heating value assumes that all 
water produced is condensed back into 
liquid, while the lower heating value 
assumes it remains as vapor, thus 
excluding the heat of vaporization from 
the total energy. 
To qualify for the credit, the fuel must 
be suitable for use as a fuel in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft (suitable for use). The 
proposed regulations define suitable for 
use to mean that the fuel either has 
practical and commercial fitness for use 
as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft 
or may be blended into a fuel mixture 
that has practical and commercial 
fitness for use as a fuel in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft. The rules clarify that 
actual use as a fuel in a highway vehicle 
or aircraft is not required. 
In addition to being suitable for use, 
section 45Z(a)(4) requires a taxpayer to 
sell transportation fuel to an unrelated 
person: (i) for use by such person in the 
production of a fuel mixture; (ii) for use 
by such person in a trade or business; 
or (iii) who sells such fuel at retail to 
another person and places such fuel in 
the fuel tank of such other person. The 
proposed regulations would explicitly 
clarify that the term ‘‘sold for use in a 
trade or business’’ includes fuel sold to 
an unrelated person that subsequently 
resells the fuel in its trade or business. 
The proposed PER process would 
require a taxpayer to submit an 
emissions value request (EVR) to the 
DOE to obtain an emissions value, 
which the taxpayer would use to file a 
petition requesting the determination of 
a PER. The proposed regulations also 
provide various special rules, including 
with respect to required registration, 
anti-stacking, production attribution, 
facility ownership, foreign feedstock 
limitation, and recordkeeping. Finally, 
the proposed regulations provide 
procedures for certification of emissions 
rates for SAF transportation fuel, filing 
procedures for claiming the section 45Z 
credit, and rules for registration.

C. Economic Analysis 
1. Baseline 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
have assessed the benefits and the costs 
of these proposed regulations relative to 
a no-action baseline reflecting 
anticipated Federal-income-tax-related 
behavior in the absence of these 
regulations. 
2. Affected Taxpayers 
These proposed regulations could 
affect both domestic corporations and 
pass-through entities. The IRS Research, 
Applied Analytics, and Statistics 
Division estimates that there will be 260 
facilities registering to produce 
transportation fuel. The Treasury 
Department and the IRS understand 
that, for many producers, each facility is 
owned by a disregarded entity. Each 
disregarded entity and qualified 
subchapter S subsidiary (QSub) that has 
an EIN and is a producer of 
transportation fuel for purposes of 
section 45Z would need to register as a 
producer of clean fuel for its owner to 
be eligible to claim the section 45Z 
credit. Therefore, the number of 
approved registrants is expected to 
exceed the number of facilities and 
credit claimants, though there is 
uncertainty in the magnitude. 
The DOE estimated that there would 
be 200 PER applicants per year for 
section 45Z credits in the June 2024 
Supporting Statement for Lifecycle 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Value 
Analysis: Clean Fuel Production Credit. 
However, due to more recent analysis 
utilizing the actual number of PER 
requests for the section 45V credit, the 
estimate has been reduced to 30 PER 
requests in the first year and declining 
over time as more pathways are added 
to the 45ZCF–GREET model. 
3. Summary of Economic Effects 
The proposed regulations define 
terms, incorporate and clarify rules, and 
provide certainty for taxpayers 
intending to claim the section 45Z 
credit. In the absence of regulations on 
the section 45Z credit, taxpayers could 
take differing positions on eligibility or 
file claims for credits that do not meet 
the statutory criteria. Clearly defined 
terms, rules, and requirements also 
provide for more efficient tax 
administration, the preservation of tax 
revenues, accurate filings, and the 
harmonization of rules across multiple 
tax credits. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
have not undertaken quantitative 
estimates of the economic effects of 
these proposed regulations. The 
Treasury Department and the IRS do not 
have readily available data or models to 
estimate with reasonable precision the 
effect on the timing and scale of 
investment behavior that could result 
from these proposed regulations. In the 
absence of such quantitative estimates, 
the Treasury Department and the IRS 
have undertaken a qualitative analysis 
of the economic effects of specific 
provisions of these proposed regulations 
relative to a no-action baseline. 
The proposed regulations incorporate 
and implement the statutory 
requirement to publish an emissions 
rate table by directing the identified 
allowed methodologies for the 
established type and categories of fuel to 
the 45ZCF–GREET and CORSIA Default 
and Actual models. The emission rate 
table thus allows taxpayer flexibility by 
reflecting a given taxpayer’s specific 
operations as inputs to the appropriate 
model. The initial emissions rate table 
provided in the Appendix of IRS Notice 
2025–11 includes the fuels listed in the 
table below.

The statute directs taxpayers to use a 
gallon equivalent for non-liquid fuels 
but does not provide a baseline 
standard. These proposed regulations 
define ‘‘gallon equivalent’’ to mean, 
with respect to any non-liquid fuel, the 
amount of such fuel that has the energy 
equivalent of a gallon of gasoline, which

Fuel Basics. 
refers to the amount of such fuel that 
has a Btu content of 116,090 (lower 
heating value). The proposed 
regulations use gasoline as the baseline 
fuel for testing gallon equivalency 
because gasoline is the most common 
transportation fuel in the United States, 
and section 45Z is designed to 
incentivize domestic production of 
transportation fuels that may serve as 
alternatives to existing fossil fuels. 
According to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (EIA), ‘‘in 
2023, petroleum products accounted for 
about 89% of total U.S. transportation 
sector energy use. Biofuels contributed 
about 6%, most of which was blended 
with petroleum fuels (gasoline, diesel 
fuel, and jet fuel).’’
9 The chart below 
using data from EIA’s Annual Energy 
Outlook 2025 shows that in 2024, motor 
gasoline made up almost 59% of the 
total of petroleum and other fuels used 
in transportation. Additionally, in the 
interest of harmonizing rules, the use of 
a gasoline gallon equivalency is 
consistent with the gasoline gallon 
equivalent requirement in section 
6426(d)(3), which applies to many of the 
same types of fuel as section 45Z in the 
context of a credit that section 45Z 
replaces. 
BILLING CODE 4831–GV–P 
BILLING CODE 4831–GV–C 
Other definitions of gallon 
equivalency were considered, including 
diesel gallon equivalency and ethanol 
gallon equivalency. These definitions 
would have the effect of decreasing 
(diesel) or increasing (ethanol) the 
amount of the calculated section 45Z 
credit without changing the 
characteristics of the fuels eligible for 
the credits. For example, the diesel 
gallon equivalent of gasoline is 0.88 
gallons, therefore using a diesel gallon 
equivalent would generally reduce any 
available credit by 12 percent for non- 
liquid fuels. Neither of these 
equivalency definitions would have 
provided the equivalency of the most 
common transportation fuel currently in 
use nor provided the same consistency 
with the gasoline gallon equivalent 
requirement in section 6426(d)(3). 
Non-liquid fuels comprise a small 
portion of the transportation fuel 
market. Renewable natural gas (RNG) 
accounted for approximately 84 percent 
of the nearly 64 billion cubic feet of all 
the natural gas used as transportation 
fuel in the United States.
10 Natural gas, 
however, accounted for less than 1% of 
total transportation fuel use.
11 In 
addition, much of the supply for RNG 
is due to clean fuel programs such as the 
national Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) 
so a small change in the credit rate for 
non-liquid fuels resulting from a 
different choice for the gallon 
equivalent for non-liquid fuels is 
unlikely to have a significant effect on 
overall transportation fuel supply. 
To facilitate implementation of a 
gallon equivalency standard for non- 
liquid fuels, these proposed regulations 
must specify whether the equivalency is 
based on a lower heating value or a 
higher heating value of the baseline fuel, 
as the two types of heating values have 
different energy contents. The proposed 
regulations use a lower heating value 
rather than a higher heating value 
because it is a better representation of 
the useful energy provided by 
transportation fuel. To provide clarity 
and to ensure consistency across section 
45Z claims, the proposed regulations 
provide the lower heating values of 
some common non-liquid fuels and an 
example for determining the number of 
gallon equivalents using the listed 
values. 
Section 45Z requires a transportation 
fuel, in part, to be suitable for use as a 
fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft but 
does not define the term ‘‘suitable for 
use.’’ The proposed regulations define 
‘‘suitable for use’’ to mean: (i) that the 
fuel has practical and commercial 
fitness for use as a fuel in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft, or (ii) may be 
blended into a fuel mixture that has 
practical and commercial fitness for use 
as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft. 
The proposed regulations further clarify 
that actual use as a fuel in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft is not required. 
The definition of ‘‘suitable for use’’ in 
these proposed regulations is consistent 
with a plain reading of the statutory 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2

12 See https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/ 
gasoline/where-our-gasoline-comes-from.php. 
language. Other options considered 
include defining ‘‘suitable for use’’ to 
require actual use as a fuel in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft. Such an 
interpretation would reduce the amount 
of fuel eligible for the credit and thus 
constrain the cost of the section 45Z 
credit. However, such an interpretation 
would not be consistent with a plain 
reading of the statutory language. 
In addition to the suitable for use 
requirement, section 45Z(a)(4) requires a 
taxpayer to sell transportation fuel to an 
unrelated person: (i) for use by such 
person in the production of a fuel 
mixture; (ii) for use by such person in 
a trade or business; or (iii) who sells 
such fuel at retail to another person and 
places such fuel in the fuel tank of such 
other person. The proposed regulations 
explicitly clarify that the term ‘‘sold for 
use in a trade or business’’ includes fuel 
sold to an unrelated person that 
subsequently resells the fuel in its trade 
or business. The proposed definition 
responds to stakeholder concern that 
more restrictive definitions could 
prevent all fuel sales for resale, such as 
those to intermediary dealers or 
wholesalers, from qualifying for the 
section 45Z credit. 
Stakeholders explained that, in the 
fuel industry, many producers sell to 
related or unrelated intermediaries, 
such as wholesalers or dealers, rather 
than directly to unrelated final 
purchasers. This common practice 
allows efficient distribution and the 
availability of biofuels across regions of 
the United States because resellers have 
the infrastructure, capacity, and 
expertise to deliver fuel where it is 
needed that producers do not.
12 The 
proposed regulatory definition promotes 
flexibility while maintaining adherence 
to the statutory language. The proposed 
regulatory definition reduces the costs 
to those producers who would need to 
alter their current distribution practices 
to take advantage of the tax credit and 
therefore creates an incentive for more 
clean fuel production. 
In considering the definition of ‘‘sold 
for use in a trade or business,’’ the 
Treasury Department and the IRS 
evaluated the potential for double 
crediting. To address that concern, the 
draft regulatory text in the Appendix to 
Notice 2025–10 defined the term ‘‘sold 
for use in a trade or business’’ to mean 
sold for use as a fuel in a trade or 
business within the meaning of section 
162 of the Code. The draft term did not 
include a sale for blending or for further 
processing, including use as a primary 
feedstock to produce another fuel. 
After the publication of Notice 2025– 
10, OBBBA amended section 
45Z(d)(5)(A) to exclude from the 
definition of ‘‘transportation fuel’’ any 
fuel produced from a fuel for which a 
section 45Z credit is allowable. This 
revision indicates that a sale for use as 
a primary feedstock to produce another 
fuel may qualify as a sale for use in a 
trade or business under section 
45Z(a)(4)(B). The OBBBA amendment 
thus eliminated the double-crediting 
potential of transportation fuel used for 
further processing, including use as a 
primary feedstock to produce another 
fuel. As a result, the proposed definition 
of ‘‘sold for use in a trade or business’’ 
in these proposed regulations responds 
to stakeholder feedback by removing the 
phrase ‘‘sold for use as a fuel’’ from the 
definition without the risk of double 
crediting for transportation fuels. 
Many stakeholders have expressed the 
urgent need for guidance to clarify the 
scope and mechanics of the PER 
process. Proposed § 1.45Z–2(f) 
implements the statutory language 
regarding the PER process and provide 
this urgent guidance to taxpayers. The 
proposed regulations provide clarity to 
taxpayer requests for a PER 
determination by delineating the proper 
forms and how to file them, as well as 
describing the content required and 
explaining the manner and effect of a 
PER determination. In addition, the 
proposed regulations direct applicants 
to follow the DOE’s published 
instructions as well as describe common 
assumptions and the information 
required by the DOE for an EVR. The 
proposed regulations also harmonize 
rules for eligible fuels that are a category 
of hydrogen by outlining the interaction 
between the PER processes for the 
section 45V credit and the section 45Z 
credit. 
The certainty provided by these 
proposed regulations would foster 
consistent treatment across credit 
claimants, allow taxpayers producing 
eligible transportation fuel to make 
informed investment decisions, and 
facilitate commercial market 
transactions with respect to contracts 
between suppliers and buyers. 
II. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520) (PRA) generally 
requires that a Federal agency obtain the 
approval of OMB before collecting 
information from the public, whether 
such collection of information is 
mandatory, voluntary, or required to 
obtain or retain a benefit. An agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and a 
person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it 
displays a valid control number 
assigned by the OMB. 
The collections of information in 
these proposed regulations contain 
reporting, third-party disclosure, and 
recordkeeping requirements that are 
necessary to ensure that the taxpayer 
qualifies for the clean fuel production 
credit. The collections will be used by 
the IRS for tax compliance purposes and 
by taxpayers to ensure the fuel qualifies 
for the credit. 
The proposed regulations describe 
reporting and recordkeeping that are 
part of the registration requirements, as 
detailed in proposed § 1.4101–1(a), (d), 
(f), and (g). These collections are used 
to determine whether an applicant 
meets the requirements to be registered 
under section 4101, a requirement to 
qualify for the section 45Z credit. The 
registration requirements, including the 
Form 637, are already approved by the 
OMB under control number 1545–1835 
with the PRA procedures under 5 CFR 
1320.10. The proposed regulations are 
not creating or changing these already 
approved collections. 
The collections of information in the 
proposed regulations describe reporting 
related to claiming the clean fuel 
production credit, as detailed in 
proposed § 1.45Z–6. The burden for 
these requirements is included with 
Form 7218 and its instructions. The 
Form 7218 and its instructions are 
already approved by OMB under the 
following control numbers: 1545–0123 
for businesses, 1545–0074 for 
individuals, 1545–0047 for non-profit 
organizations, and 1545–0092 for trusts 
and estates with the PRA procedures 
under 5 CFR 1320.10. The proposed 
regulations are not creating or changing 
these already approved collections. 
The collections of information in the 
proposed regulations would include 
reporting requirements that taxpayers 
claiming the section 45Z credit for SAF 
transportation fuel provide a 
certification from an unrelated person 
with their Federal income tax return or 
information return for each taxable year 
for which they claim the section 45Z 
credit as required by section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II) and as detailed in 
proposed § 1.45Z–5. The proposed 
regulations would also include a third- 
party reporting and disclosure 
requirement that such a certification be 
prepared and certified by an unrelated 
person. The certification must contain 
an attestation regarding the taxpayer’s 
production of SAF transportation fuel, 
conflicts of interest, the certifier’s 
qualifications, the taxpayer’s facility, 
and documentation necessary to 
substantiate the certification process. 
The taxpayer must submit the

certification to the IRS by including it 
with the Form 7218. The burden for 
these requirements is already included 
within the Form 7218 and its 
instructions. Form 7218 and its 
instructions are already approved by 
OMB under the following control 
numbers: 1545–0123 for businesses, 
1545–0074 for individuals, 1545–0047 
for tax-exempt organizations, and 1545– 
0092 for trusts and estates. The 
proposed regulations are not creating or 
changing these already approved 
collections. 
The proposed regulations reference 
the DOE’s process for an emissions 
value applicant (EV applicant) to 
request an emissions value from the 
DOE that could then be used to file a 
petition with the Secretary for a PER 
determination as detailed in proposed 
§ 1.45Z–2. The petition made to IRS will 
be performed by including the 
calculated emissions value letter 
obtained from the DOE with Form 7218. 
The burden for the petition to the IRS 
is already included within the Form 
7218 and its instructions. Form 7218 
and its instructions are already 
approved by OMB under the following 
control numbers: 1545–0123 for 
businesses, 1545–0074 for individuals, 
1545–0047 for tax-exempt organizations, 
and 1545–0092 for trusts and estates. 
The proposed regulations would not 
create or change these already approved 
collections. 
The proposed regulations would 
describe the collection of information 
associated with the process for 
taxpayers to request an EV from the 
DOE and is reflected in the DOE’s PRA 
submission relating to such process. 
These proposed regulations would not 
create or change any of the collection 
requirements submitted by the DOE to 
OMB for approval. Approval of the 
DOE’s PRA submission is pending OMB 
approval. The proposed regulations 
would not create or change any of the 
collection requirements being approved 
by OMB under the DOE OMB Control 
Number 1910–NEW. 
The collections of information in the 
proposed regulations describe third- 
party disclosure and recordkeeping 
requirements that provide safe harbor 
methods for the substantiation of 
emissions rates and qualified sales, as 
detailed in proposed § 1.45Z–4. The 
certificates described in the proposed 
regulations may be used to establish, in 
part, the taxpayer’s eligibility for the 
section 45Z credit and the amount of the 
credit claimed on the taxpayer’s return. 
The burden associated with these 
information collections will be included 
within the following OMB control 
numbers: 1545–0123 for businesses, 
1545–0074 for individuals, 1545–0047 
for tax-exempt organizations, and 1545– 
0092 for trusts and estates with the PRA 
procedures under 5 CFR 1320.10. 
The collections of information in the 
proposed regulations include 
recordkeeping requirements related to 
claiming the section 45Z credit. A 
taxpayer would use these records to 
establish its eligibility for the section 
45Z credit and the amount of the credit 
claimed. The recordkeeping 
requirements would include that 
taxpayers keep records about emissions 
rates, production, and sale. These 
recordkeeping requirements are 
considered general tax records under 
§ 1.6001–1(e). For PRA purposes, 
general tax records are already approved 
by OMB under the following control 
numbers: 1545–0123 for businesses, 
1545–0074 for individuals, 1545–0047 
for non-profit organizations, and 1545– 
0092 for trusts and estates. 
III. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes 
certain requirements with respect to 
Federal rules that are subject to the 
notice and comment requirements of 
section 553(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and 
that are likely to have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. Unless an 
agency determines that a proposal is not 
likely to have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities, section 603 of the RFA requires 
the agency to present an initial 
regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) of 
the proposed rule. The Treasury 
Department and the IRS have not 
determined whether the proposed rule, 
when finalized, will likely have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
This determination requires further 
study. However, because there is a 
possibility of significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities, an IRFA is provided in these 
proposed regulations. The Treasury 
Department and the IRS invite 
comments on both the number of 
entities affected and the economic 
impact on small entities. 
Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
Code, this notice of proposed 
rulemaking has been submitted to the 
Chief Counsel of the Office of Advocacy 
of the Small Business Administration 
for comment on its impact on small 
business. 
A. Need for and Objectives of the Rule 
The proposed regulations would 
provide needed guidance for taxpayers 
on eligibility for the section 45Z credit, 
the amount and timing of the section 
45Z credit, the use of the 45ZCF–GREET 
model and CORSIA methodologies to 
determine the lifecycle GHG emissions 
rates of transportation fuel, procedures 
for petitioning the Secretary for a PER 
determination, requirements for the 
certification of emissions rates for SAF 
transportation fuel, filing procedures for 
claiming a section 45Z credit, and rules 
for registration under section 4101 for 
purposes of section 45Z. 
B. Affected Small Entities 
The RFA directs agencies to provide 
a description of, and if feasible, an 
estimate of, the number of small entities 
that may be affected by the proposed 
regulations, if adopted. The Small 
Business Administration’s Office of 
Advocacy estimates in its 2023 FAQs 
that 99.9 percent of American 
businesses meet the definition of a small 
business. The applicability of these 
proposed regulations does not depend 
on the size of the business, as defined 
by the Small Business Administration. 
As described more fully in the preamble 
to this proposed regulation and in this 
IRFA, sections 45Z, 4101, 6417, and 
6418, and these proposed regulations 
may affect a variety of different 
businesses across several different 
industries. Because the potential credit 
claimants can vary widely and the 
credit first went into effect in 2025, it is 
difficult to estimate at this time the 
compliance costs and quantifiable 
burdens of these proposed regulations, 
if any, on small businesses. Although 
there is uncertainty as to the exact 
number of small businesses within this 
group, the current estimated number of 
taxpayers subject to these proposed 
regulations is 260 taxpayers of which 35 
percent are small. 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
expect to receive more information on 
the impact on small businesses through 
comments on these proposed 
regulations and again after taxpayers 
start using the guidance and procedures 
provided in these proposed regulations 
to claim the section 45Z credit. 
C. Impact of the Rules 
The proposed regulations would 
provide rules for how taxpayers can 
claim the section 45Z credit. Taxpayers 
that claim the section 45Z credit would 
have administrative costs related to 
reading and understanding the rules as 
well as recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements because of the certification 
and Federal income tax return or 
information return requirements. The 
costs would vary across different-sized 
entities and across the type(s) of 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5188 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
project(s) in which such entities are 
engaged. 
To claim a section 45Z credit, a 
taxpayer producing a transportation fuel 
must determine the lifecycle GHG 
emissions rate(s) for all transportation 
fuel sold during a taxable year. In 
general, a taxpayer must use the 
emissions rate table that is in effect on 
the first day of the taxable year in which 
the taxpayer produces a section 45Z 
clean transportation fuel. If an updated 
emissions rate table is published during 
a taxpayer’s taxable year of production, 
then a taxpayer may choose to use the 
updated emissions rate table. If the 
transportation fuel, pathway, or primary 
feedstock used by the taxpayer to 
produce such transportation fuel is not 
included in the applicable emissions 
rate table, the taxpayer must petition the 
Secretary for a PER. As part of the PER 
petition process, a taxpayer must apply 
to the DOE for an emissions value that 
it then uses to submit a PER petition. 
To claim a section 45Z credit for SAF 
transportation fuel, in addition to 
determining the lifecycle GHG 
emissions rate of the fuel, a taxpayer 
must submit a certification from a 
qualified certifier attesting to the 
taxpayer’s production of SAF 
transportation fuel, the amount of SAF 
transportation fuel sold by the taxpayer, 
certain general information about the 
qualified facility at which the SAF 
transportation fuel being certified was 
produced, conflicts of interest, the 
certifier’s qualifications, and 
documentation necessary to substantiate 
the certification process. Additionally, a 
taxpayer would need to retain records 
sufficient to establish compliance with 
these proposed regulations for as long as 
may be relevant. 
Although the Treasury Department 
and the IRS do not have sufficient data 
to determine precisely the likely extent 
of the increased costs of compliance, the 
estimated burden of complying with the 
recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements are described in Part II. of 
this Special Analyses regarding the 
PRA. 
D. Alternatives Considered 
The Treasury Department and the IRS 
considered alternatives to approaches 
taken in the proposed regulations. The 
proposed regulations were designed to 
minimize burdens for taxpayers while 
ensuring that the statutory requirements 
of section 45Z are met. Many of the 
compliance burdens in the proposed 
regulations are statutory requirements, 
but in an effort to reduce these burdens 
the Treasury Department and the IRS 
considered and included safe harbors 
for substantiation of emissions rates and 
substantiation of qualified sales to allow 
greater certainty for taxpayers. 
Additionally, in providing rules related 
to the information required to be 
submitted to claim the section 45Z 
credit, the Treasury Department and the 
IRS considered whether the production 
and sale of SAF transportation fuel 
could be certified by an unrelated 
person without requiring the unrelated 
person to possess certain qualifications 
or conflict of interest characteristics. 
Such an option would, however, 
increase the opportunity for fraud or 
excessive payments under section 45Z. 
Section 45Z(e) authorizes the IRS to 
issue guidance regarding 
implementation of the section 45Z 
credit and the determination of clean 
fuel production credits under section 
45Z. As described in the preamble to 
these proposed regulations, these 
proposed rules carry out that 
Congressional intent, as the certification 
requirements allow the IRS to verify the 
taxpayer’s entitlement to the section 
45Z credit. 
Comments are requested on the 
requirements in the proposed 
regulations, including specifically 
whether there are less burdensome 
alternatives that do not increase the risk 
of duplication, fraud, or improper 
payments under section 45Z. 
E. Duplicative, Overlapping, or 
Conflicting Federal Rules 
The proposed regulations would not 
duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any 
relevant Federal rules. As discussed 
previously, the proposed regulations 
would merely provide procedures and 
definitions to allow taxpayers to claim 
the section 45Z credit. The Treasury 
Department and the IRS invite 
comments on identifying and avoiding 
overlapping, duplicative, or conflicting 
requirements. 
IV. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires 
that agencies assess anticipated costs 
and benefits and take certain other 
actions before issuing a final rule that 
includes any Federal mandate that may 
result in expenditures in any one year 
by a State, local, or Tribal government, 
in the aggregate, or by the private sector, 
of $100 million (updated annually for 
inflation). These proposed regulations 
do not include any Federal mandate that 
may result in expenditures by State, 
local, or Tribal governments, or by the 
private sector, in excess of that 
threshold. 
V. Executive Order 13132: Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
prohibits an agency from publishing any 
rule that has federalism implications if 
the rule either imposes substantial 
direct compliance costs on State and 
local governments and is not required 
by statute, or preempts State law, unless 
the agency meets the consultation and 
funding requirements of section 6 of the 
Executive order. This proposed rule 
does not have federalism implications 
and does not impose substantial direct 
compliance costs on State and local 
governments or preempt State law 
within the meaning of the Executive 
order. 
Comments and Public Hearing 
Before these proposed amendments to 
the regulations are adopted as final 
regulations, consideration will be given

(18) Facility—(i) In general. For 
purposes of the definition of qualified 
facility in section 45Z(d)(4) and 
paragraph (b)(28) of this section, the 
term facility means a single production 
line that produces a transportation fuel. 
For this purpose, a single production 
line includes all components that 
function interdependently to produce a 
transportation fuel through a process 
that results in the lifecycle GHG 
emissions rate used to determine the 
credit. Components function 
interdependently to produce a 
transportation fuel if the use of each 
component is dependent upon the use 
of each of the other components to 
produce a transportation fuel. A 
component that functions 
interdependently with other 
components to produce a transportation 
fuel need not be located in the same 
building as, or within a certain 
geographic proximity to, the other 
components. A facility includes carbon 
capture equipment if such carbon 
capture equipment contributes to the 
lifecycle GHG emissions rate of the 
transportation fuel for which the credit 
is determined. A single production line 
includes all steps of the production 
process from the processing of feedstock 
through to the transportation fuel that 
the taxpayer sells in a qualified sale. 
(ii) Certain indirect production and 
post-production equipment. The term 
facility does not include— 
(A) Equipment that is used to 
condition, such as equipment used to 
blend transportation fuel into a fuel 
mixture, pressurize a fuel for use in 
transportation, or transport a 
transportation fuel beyond the point of 
production; or 
(B) Notwithstanding paragraph 
(b)(18)(iii) of this section, feedstock- 
related equipment (including 
production, purification, recovery, 
transportation, or transmission 
equipment) or electricity production 
equipment used to power the 
transportation fuel production process, 
including any carbon capture 
equipment associated with the 
electricity production process. 
(iii) Multipurpose components. 
Components that have a purpose in 
addition to the production of a 
transportation fuel may be part of a 
facility if such components function 
interdependently with other 
components to produce a transportation 
fuel. 
(iv) Examples. The following 
examples illustrate the definition of the 
term facility. 
(A) Example 1. Effect of geographic 
proximity; carbon capture equipment. Z 
produces a transportation fuel at a 
facility that is equipped with carbon 
capture equipment (as defined in 
§ 1.45Q–2(c)), as distinguished from the 
carbon capture equipment described in 
paragraph (b)(18)(ii)(B) of this section. 
One purpose of the equipment is to 
capture carbon oxides. Without the

5191 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
carbon capture equipment, the facility 
could not produce a fuel that has an 
emissions rate that would qualify for the 
section 45Z credit. Because the carbon 
capture equipment functions 
interdependently with other 
components to produce the 
transportation fuel, the carbon capture 
equipment is part of the facility under 
paragraph (b)(18)(i) of this section. The 
analysis in this example is the same 
regardless of the geographic distance 
between the carbon capture equipment 
and the rest of the components 
comprising the facility. 
(B) Example 2. Single production line 
with components functioning 
interdependently; sustainable aviation 
fuel (SAF) transportation fuel. X 
produces SAF transportation fuel that is 
a synthetic blending component that 
meets the requirements of ASTM D7566, 
Annex A2. X sells the SAF 
transportation fuel to Y, an unrelated 
person. Y blends the SAF transportation 
fuel with kerosene to create a fuel 
mixture that qualifies as jet fuel under 
ASTM D7566. X uses equipment and 
components that function 
interdependently to produce the SAF 
transportation fuel that is sold to Y. X’s 
equipment and components constitute a 
facility for section 45Z purposes. As 
described in paragraph (b)(18)(ii)(A) of 
this section, Y’s equipment and 
components used to make a 
transportation fuel mixture are blending 
equipment and are not a facility for 
section 45Z purposes. 
(19) Fuel. The term fuel means any 
liquid or gaseous substance that can be 
consumed to supply heat or power. 
Therefore, for purposes of section 45Z, 
the term fuel does not include 
electricity. 
(20) Gallon equivalent—(i) In general. 
For purposes of section 45Z(a)(1)(A), the 
term gallon equivalent means, with 
respect to any non-liquid fuel, the 
amount of such fuel that has the energy 
equivalent of a gallon of gasoline, which 
refers to the amount of such fuel that 
has a British thermal unit (Btu) content 
of 116,090 (lower heating value). 
(ii) Non-liquid fuel. A fuel is 
considered non-liquid if it is in a 
gaseous state at ambient pressure and 
temperature of 1 atmosphere and 60 
degrees Fahrenheit, respectively. 
(iii) Calculation—(A) In general. For 
any non-liquid fuel, the gallon 
equivalent of such fuel is equal to that 
fuel’s lower heating value divided by 
the lower heating value of a gallon of 
gasoline. Expressed mathematically: 
Gallon equivalent = lower heating value 
of the fuel (measured in Btu) ÷ lower 
heating value of a gallon of gasoline 
(116,090 Btu). 
(B) Rounding. The gallon equivalent 
determined under paragraph 
(b)(20)(iii)(A) of this section must be 
rounded to 5 decimal places. 
(iv) Certain lower heating values. This 
paragraph (b)(20)(iv) provides the lower 
heating values of some non-liquid fuels. 
(A) The lower heating value of low- 
GHG compressed conventional or 
alternative natural gas (CANG) is 20,267 
Btu per pound. 
(B) The lower heating value of low- 
GHG dimethyl ether is 12,417 Btu per 
pound. 
(C) The lower heating value of low- 
GHG hydrogen is 51,585 Btu per pound. 
(D) The lower heating value of low- 
GHG liquefied CANG is 20,908 Btu per 
pound. For this purpose, low-GHG 
liquefied CANG is a non-liquid fuel at 
ambient pressure and temperature of 1 
atmosphere and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. 
(E) The lower heating value of low- 
GHG liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 
(other than propane from 
hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids 
(HEFA)) is 19,873 Btu per pound. For 
this purpose, low-GHG LPG (other than 
propane from HEFA) is a non-liquid fuel 
at ambient pressure and temperature of 
1 atmosphere and 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
(F) The lower heating value of low- 
GHG LPG (propane from HEFA) is 
18,568 Btu per pound. For this purpose, 
low-GHG LPG (propane from HEFA) is 
a non-liquid fuel at ambient pressure 
and temperature of 1 atmosphere and 60 
degrees Fahrenheit. 
(v) Example. X produced 100,000 
pounds of low-GHG compressed CANG. 
To determine the number of gallon 
equivalents of low-GHG compressed 
CANG that X produced, X must divide 
the lower heating value of low-GHG 
compressed CANG (20,267 Btu per 
pound), by the lower heating value of a 
gallon of gasoline (116,090 Btu). 
Rounded to 5 decimal places, on an 
energy equivalent basis, each pound of 
low-GHG compressed CANG is equal to 
0.17458 gallon equivalents (20,267 Btu 
per lb. ÷ 116,090 Btu). Thus, X 
produced 17,458 gallon equivalents 
(0.17458 gallon equivalents × 100,000 
lbs.) of low-GHG compressed CANG. 
(21) Greenhouse gas (GHG). The term 
greenhouse gas, or GHG, has the same 
meaning given that term under section 
211(o)(1)(G) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) 
(42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(G)), as in effect on 
August 16, 2022. See section 45Z(d)(3). 
(22) Lifecycle GHG emissions. The 
term lifecycle GHG emissions means the 
lifecycle GHG emissions as described in 
section 211(o)(1)(H) of the CAA (42 
U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(H)), as in effect on 
August 16, 2022. See section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(i). 
(23) mmBTU. The term mmBTU 
means 1,000,000 British thermal units. 
See section 45Z(d)(1). 
(24) Non-SAF transportation fuel—(i) 
In general. The term non-SAF 
transportation fuel means any 
transportation fuel that is not a SAF 
transportation fuel. 
(ii) Low-GHG non-SAF fuels. This 
paragraph (b)(24)(ii) provides a non- 
exclusive list of fuels that are not 
sustainable aviation fuel (non-SAF 
fuels) that may qualify as a 
transportation fuel, as well as 
descriptions of such fuels. A listed non- 
SAF fuel that meets the applicable 
description in this paragraph (b)(24)(ii) 
must also meet all the other applicable 
requirements under section 45Z and the 
section 45Z regulations to qualify as a 
transportation fuel. 
(A) Low-GHG biodiesel. The term low- 
GHG biodiesel means the monoalkyl 
esters of long chain fatty acids that meet 
the specifications of ASTM D6751 and 
that have an emissions rate that is not 
greater than 50 kilograms of CO
2e per 
mmBTU. 
(B) Low-GHG butanol. The term low- 
GHG butanol means any mixture of n- 
butyl, sec-butyl, and iso-butyl alcohols 
that meets the specifications of ASTM 
D7862 and that has an emissions rate 
that is not greater than 50 kilograms of 
CO
2e per mmBTU. 
(C) Low-GHG diesel fuel. The term

(SAE) J2719 standard and that has an 
emissions rate that is not greater than 50 
kilograms of CO
2e per mmBTU. 
Information about SAE standards is 
available at https://www.sae.org/ 
standards. 
(H) Low-GHG liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG). The term low-GHG LPG, which 
includes low-GHG propane, means 
liquefied gases that meet the 
specifications of ASTM D1835 and that 
have an emissions rate that is not greater 
than 50 kilograms of CO
2e per mmBTU. 
(I) Low-GHG methanol. The term low- 
GHG methanol means a methyl alcohol 
that is a liquid fuel that meets the 
specifications of ASTM D1152 or ASTM 
D5797 and that has an emissions rate 
that is not greater than 50 kilograms of 
CO
2e per mmBTU. 
(J) Low-GHG conventional or 
alternative natural gas (CANG). The 
term low-GHG CANG, which includes 
renewable natural gas (RNG), means a 
pipeline-quality compressed or 
liquefied gas that is interchangeable 
with fossil natural gas, requires only 
minimal processing (for example, 
further compression or liquefaction), to 
meet the specifications of ASTM D8080, 
and that has an emissions rate that is 
not greater than 50 kilograms of CO
2e 
per mmBTU. 
(25) Prevailing wage and 
apprenticeship requirements (PWA 
requirements). The term prevailing wage 
and apprenticeship requirements or 
PWA requirements means the 
requirements described in section 
45Z(f)(6) and (7) and § 1.45Z–3. 
(26) Producer—(i) In general. Except 
as provided in paragraph (b)(26)(ii) of 
this section, the term producer means 
the person that engages in the 
production of a transportation fuel. 
(ii) Alternative natural gas. With 
respect to alternative natural gas, 
including RNG, the term producer 
means the person that processes the 
untreated sources of alternative natural 
gas to remove water, carbon dioxide, 
and other impurities such that it is 
interchangeable with fossil natural gas. 
(iii) Examples. The following 
examples illustrate the definition of the 
term producer. 
(A) Example 1. SAF producer. X uses 
vegetable oil to make 10,000 gallons of 
a synthetic blending component via a 
HEFA production pathway described in 
ASTM D7566, Annex A2, that qualifies 
as a SAF transportation fuel. X sells the 
synthetic blending component to Y, a 
blender that makes a 20,000-gallon SAF 
blend, consisting of 50 percent synthetic 
blending component and 50 percent 
petroleum-based kerosene, that meets 
the requirements of ASTM D7566. X 
and Y are unrelated. X is the producer 
of the 10,000 gallons of synthetic 
blending component that it sold to Y. Y 
is not the producer of any of the 20,000 
gallons of fuel that it blended because 
blending is not production. 
(B) Example 2. RNG producer. X 
collects biogas from an anaerobic 
digester and processes it into RNG that 
qualifies as a transportation fuel. X sells 
10,000 gallon equivalents of RNG to Y, 
a RNG wholesaler and distributer. X 
injects the 10,000 gallon equivalents of 
RNG into a pipeline. Y removes 10,000 
gallon equivalents of CANG from the 
pipeline, further compresses it, and sells 
it to a municipality that uses it to fuel 
compressed natural gas buses. X and Y 
are unrelated. X is the producer of the 
10,000 gallon equivalents of RNG. Y is 
not the producer because Y merely took 
a post-production transportation fuel 
and further compressed it. 
(27) Production—(i) In general. The 
term production (except for purposes of 
section 45Z(a)(4)(A) and paragraph 
(b)(29)(i)(A) of this section) means all 
steps and processes used to make a 
transportation fuel. Production begins 
with the processing of primary 
feedstock(s) and ends with a 
transportation fuel ready to be sold in a 
qualified sale. Production must involve 
substantial processing by the producer 
to create a transportation fuel. 
Production does not include instances 
in which a person engages in minimal 
processing, such as creating a fuel 
mixture or, except as provided for 
CANG in this paragraph (b)(27)(i), 
otherwise engaging in activities that do 
not result in a chemical transformation. 
In the case of CANG, production 
includes the act of processing the 
untreated sources of alternative natural 
gas to remove water, carbon dioxide, 
and other impurities such that it is 
interchangeable with fossil natural gas. 
Production of CANG does not include 
compressing CANG that is already 
interchangeable with fossil natural gas 
to a higher pressure. Production does 
not include instances in which a person 
uses a primary feedstock to produce a 
fuel that meets the same ASTM standard 
as the primary feedstock. Production 
must occur in the United States, which 
includes any territory of the United 
States. 
(ii) Examples. The following 
examples illustrate the definition of the 
term production. 
(A) Example 1. Minimal processing 
for stabilizing biodiesel; production in 
the United States. X, a domestic 
corporation, imports fatty acid methyl 
ester (FAME) from Canada that does not 
meet the ASTM D6751 specifications for 
biodiesel. After importation into the 
United States, X adds a stabilizing 
additive so that the FAME meets the 
specifications of ASTM D6751. The 
resulting fuel is ASTM-compliant 
biodiesel that qualifies as a 
transportation fuel. X has not produced 
the ASTM-compliant biodiesel, as X 
merely engaged in minimal processing 
by adding an additive to the imported 
FAME. Further, X did not produce the 
ASTM-compliant biodiesel in the 
United States, as X did not engage in 
substantial processing in the United 
States. Substantial processing, and thus 
production, occurred before X imported 
the FAME into the United States. 
(B) Example 2. Minimal processing for 
dehydrating hydrous ethanol; 
production in the United States. Y, a 
domestic corporation, imports hydrous 
ethanol from Mexico into the United 
States. The hydrous ethanol has 
excessive water content and does not 
meet the ASTM D4806 specifications for 
ethanol. After importation into the 
United States, Y reduces the water 
content of the hydrous ethanol. The 
resulting fuel is ASTM-compliant 
anhydrous ethanol that qualifies as a 
transportation fuel. Y has not produced 
the ASTM-compliant anhydrous 
ethanol, as Y merely engaged in 
minimal processing by dehydrating the 
imported hydrous ethanol. Further, Y 
did not produce the ASTM-compliant 
anhydrous ethanol in the United States, 
as Y did not engage in substantial 
processing in the United States. 
Substantial processing, and thus 
production, occurred before Y imported 
the hydrous ethanol into the United 
States. 
(C) Example 3. Minimal processing for 
blending ethanol and gasoline. Z, a 
domestic corporation, buys ethanol that 
qualifies as a transportation fuel and 
blends the ethanol with gasoline. Z has 
not produced a transportation fuel, as Z 
merely engaged in minimal processing 
by blending the ethanol with gasoline to 
create a fuel mixture. 
(D) Example 4. Production and 
subsequent blending by same person. Z, 
a domestic corporation, produces 
ethanol that qualifies as a transportation 
fuel and then blends the ethanol with 
gasoline. Z has engaged in production of 
a transportation fuel with respect to the 
ethanol, notwithstanding Z’s subsequent 
blending of the ethanol with gasoline. 
However, Z’s blending, alone, does not 
constitute production, as Z engaged in 
minimal processing by blending the 
ethanol with gasoline to create a fuel 
mixture. 
(28) Qualified facility—(i) In general. 
The term qualified facility means a 
facility (as defined in paragraph (b)(18) 
of this section) used to produce 
transportation fuel and excludes any 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5193 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
facility for which an anti-stacking credit 
is allowed under section 38 for the 
taxable year. See section 45Z(d)(4). For 
more information on the application of 
the anti-stacking rules, see § 1.45Z–4(b). 
(ii) Anti-stacking credit. The term 
anti-stacking credit means any one of 
the following credits listed in section 
45Z(d)(4)(B): 
(A) The credit for production of clean 
hydrogen under section 45V (section 
45V credit). 
(B) The credit determined under 
section 46 to the extent that such credit 
is attributable to the energy credit 
determined under section 48 with 
respect to any specified clean hydrogen 
production facility for which an election 
is made under section 48(a)(15) (section 
48(a)(15) election). 
(C) The credit for carbon oxide 
sequestration under section 45Q 
(section 45Q credit). 
(29) Qualified sale—(i) In general. The 
term qualified sale means a sale of 
transportation fuel in a manner 
described in section 45Z(a)(4). The term 
refers to a sale of transportation fuel by 
the taxpayer to an unrelated person if— 
(A) The fuel is sold for use in the 
production of a fuel mixture by such 
person; 
(B) The fuel is sold for use in a trade 
or business by such person; or 
(C) Such person sells such fuel at 
retail to another person and places such 
fuel in the fuel tank of such other 
person. 
(ii) Sold for use in a trade or business. 
The term sold for use in a trade or 
business means sold for use in a trade 
or business, with trade or business 
having the same meaning as in section 
162 of the Code. The term sold for use 
in a trade or business includes fuel sold 
to an unrelated person that 
subsequently resells the fuel in its trade 
or business. The term does not include 
a sale for blending or a sale to a 
purchaser that sells the fuel at retail to 
another person and places the fuel in 
the fuel tank of such other person. 
(iii) Sale by another member of a 
consolidated group. In the case of a 
corporation that is a member of an 
affiliated group of corporations filing a 
consolidated return (that is, a member of 
a consolidated group (as defined in 
§ 1.1502–1(b) and (h), respectively)), 
that corporation will be treated as 
selling fuel to an unrelated person if 
that fuel is sold to the unrelated person 
by another member of that consolidated 
group. See section 45Z(f)(3). 
(iv) Sale by related person (other than 
another member of a consolidated 
group). Except in the case of a taxpayer 
described in paragraph (b)(29)(iii) of this 
section, and in accordance with section 
45Z(f)(3), a taxpayer will be treated as 
selling fuel to an unrelated person if 
such fuel is sold to the unrelated person 
by a related person (within the meaning 
of section 45Z(f)(3) and paragraph 
(b)(36) of this section). 
(v) Examples. The following examples 
illustrate the definition of the term 
qualified sale. 
(A) Example 1. Qualified sale for use 
in a trade or business; ethanol to SAF. 
X produces ethanol and sells the 
ethanol to Y, an unrelated person. As 
part of its trade or business, Y uses the 
ethanol to produce a synthetic blending 
component under ASTM D7566, Annex 
A5 (ATJ–SPK). Y then blends the 
synthetic blending component with 
petroleum-based kerosene to make a 
sustainable aviation fuel mixture. X has 
made a qualified sale of the ethanol to 
Y under paragraphs (b)(29)(i)(B) and 
(b)(29)(ii) of this section because X sold 
the ethanol for use in Y’s trade or 
business. See paragraphs (b)(34)(iii) and 
(b)(34)(iv)(B) of this section regarding 
the application of the definition of 
transportation fuel to Y’s synthetic 
blending component. 
(B) Example 2. Qualified sale for use 
in a trade or business; RNG. X produces 
RNG that qualifies as a transportation 
fuel and sells the RNG to Y, an 
unrelated intermediary wholesaler and 
distributor. X injects the RNG into a 
pipeline for resale and distribution by 
Y. Y’s business consists of purchasing 
RNG from different producers, 
distributing it through a pipeline, and 
reselling it to customers who may be 
dealers, distributors, retailers, or end 
users of fuel. Y subsequently resells X’s 
RNG as part of Y’s business. X has made 
a qualified sale of the RNG to Y under 
paragraphs (b)(29)(i)(B) and (b)(29)(ii) of 
this section because X sold the RNG for 
use in Y’s trade or business. 
(C) Example 3. Qualified sale made 
through another member of 
consolidated group. X, a fuel producer, 
and Y, an intermediary dealer, are 
members of an affiliated group of 
corporations filing a consolidated 
return. X produces transportation fuel 
and sells the fuel to Y. Y resells the fuel 
to Z, an unrelated person. Z then sells 
the fuel at retail to a customer and 
places the fuel in the customer’s fuel 
tank. X is treated as selling the fuel to 
Z under paragraph (b)(29)(iii) of this 
section. X has made a qualified sale of 
the fuel to Z under paragraph 
(b)(29)(i)(C) of this section. 
(D) Example 4. Qualified sale made 
through related person (other than 
another member of consolidated group). 
Same facts as in paragraph (b)(29)(v)(C) 
of this section (Example 3), except that 
X and Y are non-corporate entities 
under common control and would be 
treated as a single employer under the 
regulations prescribed under section 
52(b) of the Code. X and Y are thus 
related persons within the meaning of 
section 45Z(f)(3) and paragraph (b)(36) 
of this section. X is treated as selling the 
fuel to Z under paragraph (b)(29)(iv) of 
this section. X has made a qualified sale 
of the fuel to Z under paragraph 
(b)(29)(i)(C) of this section. 
(E) Example 5. Qualified sale by 
taxpayer that produces and 
subsequently blends a fuel. X produces 
9,000 gallons of renewable diesel that 
qualifies as a transportation fuel. After 
production, X blends the 9,000 gallons 
of renewable diesel with 1,000 gallons 
of petroleum-based diesel fuel that does 
not qualify as a transportation fuel. X 
sells the resulting 10,000-gallon fuel 
blend to an unrelated person for use in 
that person’s trade or business. X has 
made a qualified sale of the 9,000 
gallons of renewable diesel, as part of 
the fuel blend, under paragraphs 
(b)(29)(i)(B) and (b)(29)(ii) of this 
section. 
(30) SAF transportation fuel—(i) In 
general. The term SAF transportation 
fuel means sustainable aviation fuel as 
defined in section 45Z(a)(3). That term 
means the non-kerosene portion of any 
liquid fuel that is a transportation fuel, 
is sold for use in an aircraft, and: 
(A) Meets the requirements of— 
(1) ASTM D7566; or 
(2) The Fischer Tropsch (FT) 
provisions of ASTM D1655, Annex A1; 
and 
(B) Is not derived from palm fatty acid 
distillates or petroleum. 
(ii) Synthetic blending component. 
The term synthetic blending component 
means the SAF portion of a fuel mixture 
described in ASTM D7566 that meets 
the specifications of one of the ASTM 
D7566 Annexes and is not derived from 
palm fatty acid distillates or petroleum. 
(iii) Sold for use in an aircraft. A 
synthetic blending component sold to a 
person that blends the fuel into a fuel 
mixture described in ASTM D7566 is 
sold for use in an aircraft within the 
meaning of section 45Z(a)(3) and 
paragraph (b)(30)(i) of this section. 
(iv) FT hydrocarbons. The term FT 
hydrocarbons means the FT 
hydrocarbons that are derived from 
biomass, used to produce jet fuel 
described in section A1.2.2.2 of ASTM 
D1655, Annex A1, and not derived from 
palm fatty acid distillates or petroleum. 
(v) ASTM D7566 Annexes. The term 
ASTM D7566 Annexes means any of the 
annexes in ASTM D7566 that provide 
the specifications for a pathway to 
create a synthetic blending component 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5194 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
that can be blended with ASTM D1655- 
compliant kerosene. 
(vi) ASTM D1655, Annex A1. The 
term ASTM D1655, Annex A1 means the 
FT provisions of ASTM D1655, Annex 
A1 that are contained in section 
A1.2.2.2, which provides a pathway for 
coprocessing up to five percent of FT 
hydrocarbons with petroleum to make a 
liquid fuel that qualifies as jet fuel. For 
purposes of this definition, the term 
petroleum includes any conventionally 
sourced hydrocarbons permitted under 
ASTM D1655, Annex A1. Liquid fuel 
produced in accordance with section 
A1.2.2.1 of ASTM D1655, Annex A1 
does not qualify for the section 45Z 
credit because section A1.2.2.1 defines 
a pathway for producing a liquid fuel 
from coprocessing an applicable 
material (or materials derived 
therefrom) with a non-biomass 
feedstock. See section 45Z(d)(5)(A)(iii). 
(31) Secretary; IRS—(i) Secretary. The 
term Secretary means the Secretary of 
the Treasury or the Secretary’s delegate. 
See section 7701(a)(11)(B). 
(ii) IRS. The term IRS means the 
Internal Revenue Service. 
(32) Section 45Z credit. The term 
section 45Z credit means the clean fuel 
production credit determined under 
section 45Z of the Code and the section 
45Z regulations. 
(33) Section 45Z regulations. The term 
section 45Z regulations means the 
regulations in this section, §§ 1.45Z–2 
through 1.45Z–6, and 1.4101–1. 
(34) Transportation fuel—(i) In 
general. The term transportation fuel 
means, pursuant to section 45Z(d)(5)(A), 
a fuel that— 
(A) Is suitable for use as a fuel in a 
highway vehicle or aircraft; 
(B) Has an emissions rate that is not 
greater than 50 kilograms of CO
2e per 
mmBTU; 
(C) Is not derived from coprocessing 
an applicable material (or materials 
derived from an applicable material) 
with a feedstock that is not biomass; and 
(D) Is not produced from a fuel for 
which a section 45Z credit is allowable. 
(ii) Suitable for use as a fuel in a 
highway vehicle or aircraft (suitable for 
use)— 
(A) In general. A fuel is suitable for 
use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or 
aircraft (suitable for use) if the fuel has 
practical and commercial fitness for use 
as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft, 
or may be blended into a fuel mixture 
that has practical and commercial 
fitness for use as a fuel in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft. A fuel may possess 
this practical and commercial fitness 
even though use in a highway vehicle or 
aircraft is not the fuel’s predominant 
use. However, a fuel does not possess 
this practical and commercial fitness 
solely by reason of its possible or rare 
use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or 
aircraft. A fuel is suitable for use at the 
point at which no further production, 
refinement, or other step is necessary 
before the fuel may be sold in a 
qualified sale, except, as specified in 
paragraph (b)(34)(ii)(B) of this section, 
for CANG. To be considered suitable for 
use, a fuel need not actually be used as 
a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft. 
(B) CANG. CANG is suitable for use 
once it is produced so that it is 
interchangeable with fossil natural gas 
and would require only minimal 
processing (for example, further 
compression or liquefaction) to meet the 
specifications of ASTM D8080. 
(C) Fuels not requiring further 
processing. A fuel that does not require 
further processing and that may be 
blended with or used as a component of 
taxable fuel (within the meaning of 
section 4083 of the Code) is suitable for 
use. 
(iii) Produced from a fuel for which a 
section 45Z credit is allowable. A fuel is 
produced from a fuel for which a 
section 45Z credit is allowable if a 
primary feedstock of the fuel meets the 
definition of a transportation fuel under 
paragraph (b)(34)(i) of this section, 
without regard to paragraph (b)(34)(i)(D) 
of this section. 
(iv) Examples. The following 
examples illustrate the definition of the 
term transportation fuel. 
(A) Example 1. Suitable for use. X 
produces diesel fuel that has practical 
and commercial fitness for use as a fuel 
in a highway vehicle or aircraft. The 
diesel fuel meets the description of low- 
GHG diesel fuel in paragraph 
(b)(24)(ii)(C) of this section, and no 
further production, refinement, or other 
step is necessary before the fuel may be 
sold in a qualified sale. X sells the 
diesel fuel to a purchaser that uses it as 
marine diesel fuel. X’s diesel fuel 
satisfies the suitable for use standard 
under paragraph (b)(34)(ii) of this 
section, notwithstanding that the diesel 
fuel ultimately is not used in a highway 
vehicle or aircraft. 
(B) Example 2. Produced from a fuel 
for which a section 45Z credit is 
allowable. Y buys ethanol and uses it as 
a primary feedstock to produce a 
synthetic blending component under 
ASTM D7566, Annex A5 (ATJ–SPK). 
The ethanol meets the definition of a 
transportation fuel under paragraph 
(b)(34)(i) of this section. Under 
paragraph (b)(34)(iii) of this section, Y 
has produced the synthetic blending 
component from a fuel for which a 
section 45Z credit is allowable. Y’s 
synthetic blending component is not a 
transportation fuel for purposes of 
section 45Z. 
(35) Types and categories of 
transportation fuel. As used in section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(i), the term type of 
transportation fuel refers to a particular 
kind of transportation fuel. For example, 
ethanol is one type of transportation 
fuel. As used in section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(i), 
the term category of transportation fuel 
means the unique primary feedstock 
and pathway (also known as production 
process) used to produce a type of 
transportation fuel. For example, 
fermentation of U.S. corn starch is one 
category of ethanol. 
(36) Unrelated person. The term 
unrelated person means a person not 
related to the taxpayer. The term has the 
same meaning as the term unrelated 
party for purposes of the certification 
required by section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II)(aa). Persons are treated 
as related to each other if such persons 
would be treated as a single employer 
under the regulations prescribed under 
section 52(b) of the Code. See section 
45Z(f)(3). 
(c) Applicability date. This section 
applies to qualified sales occurring in 
taxable years ending on or after [date of 
publication of final regulations in the 
Federal Register]. 
§ 1.45Z–2 General rules. 
(a) Amount of credit—(1) In general. 
For purposes of section 38, the section 
45Z credit for any taxable year, with 
respect to a given transportation fuel, is 
an amount equal to the product of— 
(i) The applicable amount for such 
fuel; 
(ii) The total gallons or gallon 
equivalents of such fuel that were— 
(A) Produced by the taxpayer at a 
qualified facility; and 
(B) Sold by the taxpayer in a qualified 
sale during the taxable year; and 
(iii) The emissions factor for such 
fuel. 
(2) Determination of whether fuel is 
liquid or non-liquid; measurement. 
Whether a fuel is liquid or non-liquid is 
determined according to § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(20)(ii). The volume of a liquid fuel 
is measured on the basis of gallons 
adjusted to ambient pressure and 
temperature of 1 atmosphere and 60 
degrees Fahrenheit. The gallon 
equivalent of a non-liquid fuel is 
calculated according to § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(20)(iii). 
(3) Calculation rules—(i) Rounding. If 
the amount of any section 45Z credit, as 
calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, is not a multiple of one cent, a 
taxpayer must round such amount to the 
nearest cent. A taxpayer must round up 
any amount ending in 0.5 cents or more

5195 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
and round down any amount ending in 
less than 0.5 cents. 
(ii) Pro rata allocation required for 
sales of transportation fuel in common 
storage—(A) In general. If a taxpayer 
sells transportation fuel that is held in 
common storage with other fuels that 
have different emissions rates, the 
taxpayer is treated as selling a pro rata 
portion of each fuel produced after 
December 31, 2024, and held in such 
common storage. As described in 
§ 1.45Z–1(b)(27), the blending of fuels 
while such fuels are held in common 
storage does not constitute production 
of a transportation fuel with a distinct 
emissions rate. 
(B) Example. In 2025, X produces 
1,000,000 gallons of ethanol at three 
different facilities: 200,000 gallons, or 
20%, at Facility 1; 250,000 gallons, or 
25%, at Facility 2; and 550,000 gallons, 
or 55%, at Facility 3. The ethanol 
produced at Facility 1 has an emissions 
factor of 0.5. The ethanol produced at 
Facility 2 has an emissions factor of 0.1. 
The ethanol produced at Facility 3 is 
not a transportation fuel and no section 
45Z credit may be determined with 
respect to it. X places 1,000,000 gallons 
of ethanol in common storage tanks. In 
2025, X sells 600,000 gallons of ethanol 
from the common storage tanks in 
qualified sales. Of the 600,000 gallons 
sold, 120,000 gallons (20%) are 
allocated to Facility 1, 150,000 gallons 
(25%) are allocated to Facility 2, and 
330,000 gallons (55%) are allocated to 
Facility 3. X otherwise satisfies the 
requirements of the section 45Z credit, 
and Facility 1 and 2 satisfy the 
prevailing wage and apprenticeship 
(PWA) requirements. Therefore, X’s 
section 45Z credit amount is calculated 
as follows: ($1.06 × 120,000 × 0.5) + 
($1.06 × 150,000 × 0.1) = ($127,200 × 
0.5) + ($159,000 × 0.1) = $63,600 + 
$15,900 = $79,500. The result does not 
change if ethanol produced before 
January 1, 2025, was also in the 
common storage tanks. 
(4) Applicable amount—(i) In general. 
The applicable amount is either the base 
amount for transportation fuel produced 
at a qualified facility that does not 
satisfy the PWA requirements, or the 
alternative amount for transportation 
fuel produced at a qualified facility that 
satisfies the PWA requirements. The 
applicable amount is subject to inflation 
adjustment for calendar years beginning 
after 2024, as described in paragraph 
(a)(4)(iv) of this section. 
(ii) Base amount. The base amount is 
either— 
(A) For transportation fuel produced 
on or before December 31, 2025, 20 
cents for transportation fuel which is 
not sustainable aviation fuel (non-SAF 
transportation fuel) and 35 cents for 
SAF transportation fuel; or 
(B) For transportation fuel produced 
after December 31, 2025, 20 cents. 
(iii) Alternative amount. The 
alternative amount is either— 
(A) For transportation fuel produced 
on or before December 31, 2025, $1.00 
for non-SAF transportation fuel and 
$1.75 for SAF transportation fuel; or 
(B) For transportation fuel produced 
after December 31, 2025, $1.00. 
(iv) Inflation adjustment—(A) In 
general. For calendar years beginning 
after 2024, the applicable amount for 
any transportation fuel is adjusted by 
multiplying such amount by the 
inflation adjustment factor for the 
calendar year in which the qualified 
sale of the transportation fuel occurs. If 
any inflation adjusted amount is not a 
multiple of one cent, such amount will 
be rounded to the nearest multiple of 
one cent. See section 45Z(c)(1). A 
taxpayer must round up any amount 
ending in 0.5 cents or higher and round 
down any amount ending in less than 
0.5 cents. 
(B) Inflation adjustment factor. The 
term inflation adjustment factor means 
the inflation adjustment factor 
determined and published by the 
Secretary of the Treasury or the 
Secretary’s delegate (Secretary) pursuant 
to section 45Y(c) of the Code, 
determined by substituting ‘‘calendar 
year 2022’’ for ‘‘calendar year 1992’’ in 
section 45Y(c)(3). See section 45Z(c)(2). 
Accordingly, the inflation adjustment 
factor is, with respect to a calendar year, 
a fraction whose numerator is the gross 
domestic product (GDP) implicit price 
deflator for the preceding calendar year 
and whose denominator is the GDP 
implicit price deflator for the calendar 
year 2022. The term GDP implicit price 
deflator means the most recent revision 
of the implicit price deflator for the GDP 
as computed and published by the 
Department of Commerce before March 
15 of the calendar year. See section 
45Y(c)(3). 
(C) Publication of inflation 
adjustment factor. The Secretary will 
publish guidance in the Internal 
Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601 of this 
chapter) no more frequently than 
annually that will provide the inflation 
adjustment factor. 
(b) Timing of credit—(1) In general. A 
taxpayer is eligible to claim the section 
45Z credit only for the taxable year in 
which the qualified sale of a 
transportation fuel occurs, provided the 
taxpayer meets all other requirements to 
claim the credit. 
(2) Credit not allowed for production 
before January 1, 2025. The section 45Z 
credit is not allowed for transportation 
fuel produced before January 1, 2025. 
(3) Qualified sale timing—(i) 
Production. Production of a 
transportation fuel may take place in an 
earlier taxable year than the taxable year 
in which the qualified sale of such fuel 
occurs. However, a qualified sale cannot 
take place before the date the fuel is 
produced. 
(ii) Sale to unrelated person. A 
qualified sale occurs at the time of the 
sale to the unrelated person. If a 
taxpayer is treated as selling 
transportation fuel to an unrelated 
person under §
1.45Z–1(b)(29)(iii) or (iv) 
(involving sales by related persons), the 
qualified sale occurs at the time the 
related person sells the fuel to an 
unrelated person. 
(iii) Example of qualified sale timing 
for member of consolidated group. X, a 
fuel producer, and Y, an intermediary 
dealer, are members of an affiliated 
group of corporations filing a 
consolidated return. The affiliated 
group, including X and Y, uses the 
calendar year as its taxable year. In 
2025, X produces transportation fuel 
and sells the fuel to Y. In 2026, Y resells 
the fuel to Z, an unrelated person. Z 
then sells the fuel at retail to a customer 
and places the fuel in the customer’s 
fuel tank. For purposes of section 45Z, 
X is treated as selling the fuel to Z under 
§ 1.45Z–1(b)(29)(iii) and has made a 
qualified sale. X’s qualified sale to Z 
occurs in 2026 when Y sells the fuel to 
Z. Thus, X may only claim a section 45Z 
credit for that fuel for the 2026 taxable 
year (assuming all other requirements 
for the section 45Z credit are met). 
(c) Emissions factor—(1) In general. 
Under section 45Z(b)(1)(A), the 
emissions factor of a transportation fuel 
is an amount equal to the quotient of— 
(i) An amount equal to— 
(A) 50 kilograms (kg) of equivalent 
carbon dioxide (CO
2e) per 1,000,000 
British thermal units (mmBTU); minus 
(B) The emissions rate for such fuel; 
divided by— 
(ii) 50 kg of CO2e per mmBTU. 
(2) Rounding—(i) In general. If the 
emissions factor of a transportation fuel 
is not a multiple of 0.1, a taxpayer must 
round such amount to the nearest 
multiple of 0.1. A taxpayer must round 
up if the digit in the hundredths place 
is a 5 or higher, and round down if the 
digit in the hundredths place is less 
than 5. 
(ii) Example. Y produces a 
transportation fuel with an emissions 
rate of 21.25 kg of CO
2e per mmBTU. 
The emissions factor of Y’s fuel is 
initially calculated as follows: 
(50¥21.25) ÷ 50 = 0.575. 0.575 is not a 
multiple of 0.1, so Y must round the

5196 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
emissions factor to the nearest multiple 
of 0.1. Thus, the emissions factor of Y’s 
fuel is 0.6. If instead the emissions rate 
of Y’s fuel were 23 kg of CO
2e per 
mmBTU, resulting in an initial 
calculation of the emissions factor as 
0.54, Y must round the emissions factor 
down to 0.5. 
(d) Emissions rate—(1) In general. The 
emissions rate for a transportation fuel 
is such fuel’s lifecycle greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions expressed as kg of 
CO
2e per mmBTU, either as established 
in the applicable emissions rate table 
published by the Secretary (pursuant to 
section 45Z(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (e) of 
this section), or, in the case of any 
transportation fuel for which an 
emissions rate has not been established 
in the applicable emissions rate table, a 
provisional emissions rate (PER) 
determined by the Secretary with 
respect to such fuel (pursuant to section 
45Z(b)(1)(D) and paragraph (f) of this 
section). 
(2) Negative emissions rates—(i) In 
general. The emissions rate of a 
transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025, may not be less than 
zero (with a resulting emissions factor 
greater than one), unless such fuel is 
produced from a primary feedstock that 
is an animal manure. This limitation 
also applies to any transportation fuel 
(as defined in § 1.45Z–1(b)(34)) used as 
a production input. 
(ii) Examples. The following 
examples illustrate the rules regarding 
negative emissions rates. 
(A) Example 1. Prohibition of negative 
emissions rate except for transportation 
fuel produced from animal manure. In 
2026, X produces renewable natural gas 
(RNG) by anaerobic digestion and biogas 
upgrading of an animal manure, and Y 
produces RNG by anaerobic digestion 
and biogas upgrading of landfill gas. 
The emissions rates of X’s and Y’s fuels 
are both, without further adjustment, 
¥10 kg of CO
2e per mmBTU. X’s fuel 
is produced from animal manure, so no 
adjustment of the emissions rate is 
necessary and the emissions factor for 
X’s fuel is 1.2. However, because Y’s 
fuel is not produced from animal 
manure, the emissions rate for Y’s fuel 
must be adjusted up to 0, so the 
emissions factor for Y’s fuel is 1.0. 
(B) Example 2. Prohibition of negative 
emissions rate for transportation fuel 
used as production input. In 2026, Z 
produces ethanol by fermentation of 
U.S. corn starch. As part of the ethanol 
production process, Z buys alternative 
natural gas and uses it as process fuel. 
The alternative natural gas meets the 
definition of a transportation fuel under 
§ 1.45Z–1(b)(34) and has an emissions 
rate of ¥100 kg of CO
2e per mmBTU. 
However, the alternative natural gas is 
not derived from animal manure and 
serves only as a process fuel, not the 
primary feedstock (see § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(34)(iii), § 1.45Z–1(b)(35), and 
paragraph (e) of this section), for Z’s 
ethanol. For purposes of accounting for 
the alternative natural gas when 
calculating the emissions rate for Z’s 
ethanol, Z must adjust the emissions 
rate of the alternative natural gas up to 
0 kg of CO
2e per mmBTU. 
(3) Indirect land use change excluded. 
For transportation fuel produced after 
December 31, 2025, the emissions rate 
of a fuel does not include any emissions 
attributed to indirect land use change. 
See section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(iv). 
(e) Emissions rate table—(1) In 
general. As required by section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(i), the Secretary will 
annually publish a table that establishes 
the emissions rate for similar types and 
categories of transportation fuels (as 
defined in § 1.45Z–1(b)(35)) based on 
the lifecycle GHG emissions for such 
fuels expressed as kg of CO
2e per 
mmBTU (emissions rate table), which a 
taxpayer must use for purposes of the 
section 45Z credit. The emissions rate 
table for each calendar year will be 
published in the Internal Revenue 
Bulletin (see § 601.601 of this chapter). 
A taxpayer must use the applicable 
emissions rate table as specified in 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 
(2) Applicable emissions rate table— 
(i) In general. For taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 2024, the 
applicable emissions rate table for a 
taxpayer is the emissions rate table that 
is in effect on the first day of the 
taxpayer’s taxable year of production. 
For production after December 31, 2024, 
in taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 2025, the applicable 
emissions rate table is the emissions rate 
table effective for 2025. 
(ii) Use of applicable emissions rate 
table. A taxpayer that produces a fuel 
for which the applicable emissions rate 
table establishes an emissions rate must 
use the corresponding allowed 
methodologies, as specified in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, 
provided in such table to determine the 
emissions rate for all such fuel 
produced during the taxpayer’s taxable 
year. 
(iii) Emissions rate established in 
emissions rate table—(A) In general. An 
emissions rate table establishes the 
emissions rate for a fuel if the emissions 
rate table includes both the type and 
category of fuel. An emissions rate table 
does not establish the emissions rate for 
a fuel if such table includes the type but 
not the category of fuel. 
(B) Effect of additions to methodology. 
If an emissions rate table does not 
initially include a type or category of 
fuel but an allowed methodology is 
updated to add such type or category of 
fuel during the calendar year, then that 
type or category of fuel will be 
considered included in such emissions 
rate table. 
(iv) Examples. The following 
examples illustrate the rules regarding 
the applicable emissions rate table. 
(A) Example 1. General rule for 
identifying applicable emissions rate 
table. X, a calendar year taxpayer, is a 
fuel producer. In 2025, X produces 
biodiesel by transesterification of U.S. 
soybean oil. The emissions rate table for 
calendar year 2025 includes both 
biodiesel, the type of fuel X produces, 
and transesterification of U.S. soybean 
oil, the category of biodiesel X 
produces. Therefore, the emissions rate 
table for calendar year 2025 establishes 
the emissions rate for X’s biodiesel and 
is the applicable emissions rate table for 
all of X’s production of such biodiesel 
in 2025. 
(B) Example 2. Type or category of 
fuel added to allowed methodology. Y, 
a calendar year taxpayer, is a fuel 
producer. In 2025, Y produces biodiesel 
by transesterification of Canadian 
soybean oil. The emissions rate table for 
calendar year 2025 includes the type of 
fuel Y produces, biodiesel. However, the 
2025 emissions rate table for calendar 
year 2025 does not include 
transesterification of Canadian soybean 
oil, the category of biodiesel Y 
produces. The initial version of the 
45ZCF–GREET model, an allowed 
methodology, released January 15, 2025, 
also includes the type but not the 
category of fuel Y produces. On June 1, 
2025, the U.S. Department of Energy 
(DOE) publicly releases an updated 
version of the 45ZCF–GREET model that 
adds the transesterification of Canadian 
soybean oil for biodiesel. Because the 
update to the 45ZCF–GREET model 
adds the category of biodiesel Y 
produces during the calendar year, the 
emissions rate table for calendar year 
2025 is considered to include the 
category of fuel Y produces. As such, 
the emissions rate table for calendar 
year 2025 establishes the emissions rate 
for Y’s biodiesel and is the applicable 
emissions rate table for all of Y’s 
production of such biodiesel in 2025. 
(3) Allowed methodologies for 
emissions rate table—(i) In general. A 
taxpayer producing a fuel for which an 
emissions rate is established by the 
applicable emissions rate table must 
determine the fuel’s emissions rate 
using the methodologies allowed under 
paragraphs (e)(3)(iv) and (v) of this 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5197 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
section (allowed methodologies or 
allowed methodology), as directed by 
the applicable emissions rate table. 
(ii) Use of most recent version of 
allowed methodology—(A) In general. A 
taxpayer must use the first version of an 
allowed methodology that is publicly 
available in the taxable year of 
production and that includes the type 
and category of such fuel (most recent 
version of an allowed methodology). If 
an allowed methodology is updated 
with respect to an included type or 
category of fuel and such updated 
methodology becomes publicly 
available after the first day of the taxable 
year of production but still within such 
taxable year, then the taxpayer may, at 
its discretion, treat such updated 
version as the most recent version of 
such methodology. 
(B) Examples. The following 
examples illustrate the rules regarding 
allowed methodologies. 
(1) Example 1. Choice after 
methodology update. X, a calendar year 
taxpayer, is a fuel producer. In 2025, X 
produces biodiesel by transesterification 
of U.S. soybean oil. The 2025 emissions 
rate table is the applicable emissions 
rate table; it identifies the 45ZCF– 
GREET model as the only allowed 
methodology. The initial version of the 
45ZCF–GREET model, released January 
15, 2025, includes the type and category 
of the fuel X produces. On June 1, 2025, 
the DOE publicly releases a version of 
the 45ZCF–GREET model that updates 
the transesterification pathway. Under 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, X 
may use either the January 15, 2025, or 
the June 1, 2025, version of the 45ZCF– 
GREET model to calculate the emissions 
rate for all biodiesel produced using 
such pathway in 2025. 
(2) Example 2. Addition of type or 
category of fuel to methodology without 
further updates. Y, a calendar year 
taxpayer, is a fuel producer. In 2025, Y 
produces biodiesel by transesterification 
of Canadian soybean oil. The initial 
version of the 45ZCF–GREET model, 
released January 15, 2025, includes the 
type, but not the category, of fuel Y 
produces. On June 1, 2025, the DOE 
publicly releases an updated version of 
the 45ZCF–GREET model that adds the 
transesterification of Canadian soybean 
oil for biodiesel. As such, the 2025 
emissions rate table is considered to 
include Y’s type and category of fuel; it 
identifies the 45ZCF–GREET model as 
the only allowed methodology. Under 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, 
because the June 1, 2025, version of the 
45ZCF–GREET model is the first 
publicly available version that includes 
Y’s type and category of fuel, Y must 
use the June 1, 2025, version of the 
45ZCF–GREET model to calculate the 
emissions rate for all biodiesel it 
produced by transesterification of 
Canadian soybean oil in 2025. 
(3) Example 3. Choice of methodology 
after addition of type or category of fuel 
to methodology. Same facts as in 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B)(2) of this section 
(Example 2), except that on September 
1, 2025, the DOE publicly releases a 
version of the 45ZCF–GREET model that 
updates the transesterification of 
Canadian soybean oil pathway. Under 
paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, Y 
cannot use the January 15, 2025, version 
of the 45ZCF–GREET model, but may 
use either the June 1, 2025, or the 
September 1, 2025, version of the 
45ZCF–GREET model to calculate the 
emissions rate for all biodiesel it 
produced using such pathway in 2025. 
(iii) 45ZCF–GREET model as a 
successor model—(A) In general. For 
purposes of section 45Z(b)(1)(B)(ii), the 
45ZCF–GREET model is a successor 
model. 
(B) Certain emissions accounting 
rules—(1) In general. In the 45ZCF– 
GREET model, for purposes of 
accounting for emissions associated 
with hydrogen (as a production input), 
natural gas alternatives (as a production 
input or as the transportation fuel 
produced), electricity, and carbon 
capture and sequestration, rules similar 
to the rules under section 45V of the 
Code apply, unless otherwise specified 
by the 45ZCF–GREET model with 
respect to technical modeling issues that 
are subsequently identified by the DOE 
or technical differences arising from the 
application of the section 45V rules to 
the 45ZCF–GREET model. 
(2) Similar rule for use of energy 
attribute certificates (EACs); 
incrementality. With respect to the use 
of an EAC within the 45ZCF–GREET 
model, rules similar to § 1.45V–4(d) 
apply. When applying the 
incrementality rules in § 1.45V– 
4(d)(3)(i) for purposes of the 45ZCF– 
GREET model, a taxpayer’s facility is 
considered placed in service in the first 
taxable year it produces a transportation 
fuel. Thus, the electricity-generating 
facility that produced the unit of 
electricity to which the EAC relates 
must have a commercial operations date 
(COD) that is no more than 36 months 
before the first day of the taxable year 
that the facility for which the EAC is 
retired first produced a transportation 
fuel, or, if the electricity represented by 
the EAC is produced by an electricity- 
generating facility that uses carbon 
capture and sequestration (CCS) 
technology, such technology has a 
placed in service date that is no more 
than 36 months before the first day of 
the taxable year that the facility for 
which the EAC is retired first produced 
a transportation fuel. 
(3) Example. Similar incrementality 
rules applied to existing fuel production 
facility. X owns and operates Facility, 
which has produced ethanol by 
fermentation of U.S. corn starch since 
2002. On January 1, 2024, X finishes 
upgrading Facility, so that the ethanol 
produced at Facility has an emissions 
rate that is less than 50 kg of CO
2e per 
mmBTU. For purposes of accounting for 
emissions associated with electricity, X 
purchases and retires EACs and uses 
those EACs when calculating the 
emissions rate of its ethanol. Although 
Facility has been operating since 2002, 
it only began producing a transportation 
fuel on January 1, 2024. For purposes of 
applying the incrementality rules to 
EACs used within the 45ZCF–GREET 
model, Facility is considered placed in 
service on January 1, 2024. Thus, an 
electricity generating facility that 
produced a unit of electricity to which 
the EACs relate must have a COD no 
earlier than January 1, 2021. 
(iv) Methodology for non-SAF 
transportation fuel. If the applicable 
emissions rate table establishes the 
emissions rate for a non-SAF 
transportation fuel, then a taxpayer 
producing such fuel must determine the 
fuel’s emissions rate using the 45ZCF– 
GREET model, as directed by the 
applicable emissions rate table. 
(v) Methodologies for SAF 
transportation fuel. If the applicable 
emissions rate table establishes the 
emissions rate for a SAF transportation 
fuel, then a taxpayer producing such 
fuel must determine the fuel’s emissions 
rate using the most recent version of the 
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction 
Scheme for International Aviation 
(CORSIA) Default Life Cycle Emissions 
Values for CORSIA Eligible Fuels 
lifecycle approach (CORSIA Default) or 
the CORSIA Methodology for 
Calculating Actual Life Cycle Emissions 
Values lifecycle approach (CORSIA 
Actual) (as described in § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(10)(ii)), or the 45ZCF–GREET 
model, as directed by the applicable 
emissions rate table. A taxpayer may 
choose, for each type and category of 
SAF transportation fuel that it produces, 
which of these methodologies to use. 
For a given type and category of SAF 
transportation fuel, a taxpayer must use 
the same methodology to calculate 
lifecycle GHG emissions associated with 
all stages of SAF production, from 
feedstock production through 
distribution. See § 1.45Z–5, Procedures 
for certification of lifecycle greenhouse 
gas emissions rates, for information on 
how to certify compliance with these 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5198 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
methodologies. For purposes of section 
45Z(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II), the 45ZCF–GREET 
model is a similar methodology to 
CORSIA. 
(vi) Additional instructions on 
methodologies. A taxpayer must use an 
allowed methodology in accordance 
with the applicable emissions rate table, 
accurately enter all information 
requested by such methodology, and 
follow all publicly available instructions 
for the use of such methodology. 
(f) Provisional emissions rate (PER)— 
(1) In general. If a taxpayer produces an 
eligible fuel, as defined in § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(12), then the taxpayer may file a 
petition with the Secretary for a 
determination of the emissions rate 
(provisional emissions rate (PER)) for 
such eligible fuel (PER petition). See 
section 45Z(b)(1)(D). Before filing a PER 
petition, the taxpayer must first submit 
a request to the DOE for an emissions 
value (EV) for an eligible fuel (emissions 
value request (EVR)). The DOE will 
consider such taxpayer the emissions 
value applicant (EV applicant). The EV 
applicant must receive a calculated 
emissions value letter (CEVL) from the 
DOE for such fuel. Before submitting an 
EVR, an EV applicant must review the 
applicable emissions rate table and the 
most recent version of the allowed 
methodologies to ensure that the 
applicable emissions rate table has not 
already established the emissions rate 
for the EV applicant’s type and category 
of fuel. After obtaining a CEVL, the 
taxpayer may then file a PER petition for 
the eligible fuel that is the subject of the 
CEVL. The EV applicant must submit an 
EVR to the DOE in accordance with the 
procedures described in paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section. The taxpayer must 
submit a PER petition in accordance 
with the procedures described in 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section. The DOE 
and the IRS, respectively, will deny any 
EVR or PER petition that does not 
follow the procedures in this paragraph 
(f). 
(2) Threshold requirements. An EV 
applicant may submit an EVR, and 
subsequently a PER petition, only for an 
eligible fuel. The DOE and the IRS, 
respectively, will deny any EVR or PER 
petition for a type and category of fuel 
included in the applicable emissions 
rate table. Additionally, the DOE and 
the IRS, respectively, will deny any EVR 
or PER petition based on a facility rather 
than a type or category of fuel. 
(3) Procedures for requesting 
emissions value from DOE—(i) In 
general. The DOE will publish specific 
guidance and procedures for an EV 
applicant to submit an EVR to the DOE. 
An EV applicant that submits an EVR 
must follow the procedures specified by 
the DOE to request and obtain such 
emissions value, including the DOE’s 
Section 45Z EVR process instructions 
(Instructions). The DOE will evaluate an 
EVR using the same well-to-wheel 
system boundary that the 45ZCF– 
GREET model employs. As used in this 
paragraph (f)(3), the term well-to-wheel 
includes well-to-wake with respect to 
aviation fuel. Additionally, the DOE 
will treat background data parameters in 
the 45ZCF–GREET model (fixed data 
that a 45ZCF–GREET model user cannot 
change) as background data (fixed data 
that an EV applicant cannot change) in 
evaluating an EVR. For purposes of 
accounting for emissions associated 
with hydrogen (as a production input), 
natural gas alternatives (as a production 
input or as the transportation fuel 
produced), electricity, and carbon 
capture and sequestration, rules similar 
to the rules under section 45V apply, 
unless otherwise specified by the DOE 
with respect to subsequent technical 
modeling issues or technical differences 
arising from the application of the 
section 45V rules to an eligible fuel. The 
DOE may decline to review an EVR that 
is not responsive, including an EVR that 
is not for an eligible fuel or an EVR that 
is incomplete. An EV applicant seeking 
a new emissions value for a given type 
and category of fuel after the DOE has 
completed its analysis may reapply only 
if the EV applicant wishes to resubmit 
its EVR with new or revised technical 
information or clarifications related to 
the information previously submitted. 
An EVR is complete once the DOE 
either issues the EV applicant a CEVL or 
denies the EVR. 
(ii) Required information for an 
EVR—(A) EVR for an eligible fuel that 
is not a category of hydrogen. An EV 
applicant submitting an EVR for an 
eligible fuel that is not a category of 
hydrogen must submit the following 
information to the DOE: 
(1) Specific sections of the Class 3 
front-end engineering and design 
(FEED) study (or studies) as defined by 
the Association for the Advancement of 
Cost Engineering (AACE) International 
Recommended Practice No. 18R–97, or 
similar indication of project maturity 
such as project specification and cost 
estimation sufficient to inform a final 
investment decision, as determined by 
the DOE, that has been completed for 
each qualified facility at which the 
applicant produces the eligible fuel, as 
described further in the Instructions; 
and 
(2) A completed Section 45Z EVR 
Form, as described in the Instructions. 
(B) EVR for an eligible fuel that is a 
category of hydrogen. An EV applicant 
submitting an EVR for an eligible fuel 
that is a category of hydrogen must first 
submit a section 45V Emissions Value 
Request Application under the process 
for a provisional emissions rate 
determination for the section 45V credit, 
as described in § 1.45V–4(c). An EV 
applicant submitting an EVR for an 
eligible fuel that is a category of 
hydrogen must submit to the DOE, in 
addition to the general requirements in 
paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the 
letter obtained under the section 45V 
emissions value request process from 
the DOE stating the well-to-gate 
emissions value that the DOE 
determined with respect to the facility’s 
hydrogen production pathway and the 
control number that the DOE assigned to 
the section 45V Emissions Value 
Request Application. If the EV applicant 
produces that category of hydrogen at 
multiple facilities, such applicant will 
need to provide this information for 
each facility. Once such an EV applicant 
goes through the section 45V emissions 
value request process and then submits 
their EVR for purposes of section 45Z, 
the DOE may issue a CEVL that includes 
an emissions value that fully accounts 
for the well-to-wheel emissions of that 
category of hydrogen. 
(4) Procedures for requesting PER 
determination—(i) In general. To 
request a PER determination, a taxpayer 
must file a PER petition with the 
Form(s) 7218 included with the 
taxpayer’s timely filed (including 
extensions) Federal income tax return or 
Federal information return for the first 
taxable year for which the taxpayer 
claims the section 45Z credit for the 
eligible fuel to which the PER petition 
relates. 
(ii) Required information for a PER 
petition. A PER petition must include 
the CEVL received from the DOE with 
respect to the eligible fuel. If the 
taxpayer obtained more than one 
emissions value from the DOE, the 
taxpayer must include the CEVL for 
each eligible fuel for which it is 
claiming a section 45Z credit for a given 
taxable year with the relevant Form(s) 
7218. The CEVL(s) included with the 
Form(s) 7218 constitutes the PER 
petition. 
(5) Determination of a PER—(i) In 
general. Upon the taxpayer’s filing of a 
PER petition pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(4) of this section, the PER petition 
will be deemed accepted by the IRS. 
The IRS’s deemed acceptance of such 
PER petition is the Secretary’s 
determination of the PER. 
(ii) Reliance on emissions value. A 
taxpayer may rely upon an emissions 
value provided by the DOE in a CEVL 
for purposes of calculating and claiming 
the section 45Z credit, provided that all 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5199 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
information, representations, or other 
data provided to the DOE in support of 
the emissions value request are 
accurate. If an applicable emissions rate 
table subsequently establishes an 
emissions rate for a fuel subject to a 
CEVL, a taxpayer must use the 
applicable emissions rate table and may 
no longer rely on the CEVL for the fuel. 
(6) Not an examination of books and 
records. The Secretary’s PER 
determination is not an examination or 
inspection of books of account for 
purposes of section 7605(b) of the Code 
and does not preclude or impede the 
IRS (under section 7605(b) or any 
administrative provisions adopted by 
the IRS) from later examining a return 
or inspecting books or records with 
respect to any taxable year for which the 
section 45Z credit is claimed. For 
example, any information, 
representations, or other data provided 
to the DOE in an EVR are still subject 
to examination. Further, a PER 
determination does not signify that the 
IRS has determined that any other 
requirements of the section 45Z credit 
have been satisfied for any taxable year. 
(g) Emissions rates (including PER) 
relate back to January 1, 2025. The first 
emissions rate determined for a type 
and category of fuel, whether 
established in an applicable emissions 
rate table or through the PER process, 
relates back to January 1, 2025. 
(h) Applicability date. This section 
applies to qualified sales occurring in 
taxable years ending on or after [date of 
publication of final regulations in the 
Federal Register], except that paragraph 
(e) of this section applies to qualified 
sales occurring in taxable years ending 
on or after January 10, 2025. 
■ Par. 3. Sections 1.45Z–4 through 
1.45Z–6 are added to read as follows: 
§ 1.45Z–4 Special Rules. 
(a) Registered production in the 
United States required. No section 45Z 
credit is determined with respect to any 
transportation fuel unless the taxpayer 
is registered, or is treated as being 
registered, as a producer of clean fuel 
under section 4101 of the Code at the 
time of production and the fuel is 
produced in the United States, which 
includes any territory of the United 
States. See § 1.45Z–6(b) for special rules 
regarding registration if the taxpayer is 
not the producer. See § 1.4101–1 for the 
registration rules that apply for 
purposes of the section 45Z credit. 
(b) Anti-stacking rules—(1) In general. 
This paragraph (b) provides rules for 
determining whether an anti-stacking 
credit (as defined in § 1.45Z–1(b)(28)(ii)) 
has been allowed for a taxable year with 
respect to a facility. Section 
45Z(d)(4)(B). 
(2) Determination of qualified 
facility—(i) In general. The 
determination of whether a facility is a 
qualified facility must be made 
separately for each taxable year. 
Whether a facility is a qualified facility 
for a given taxable year depends on 
whether the facility produced 
transportation fuel sold during that 
taxable year and whether an anti- 
stacking credit was allowed for that 
taxable year with respect to the facility. 
A facility may be a qualified facility in 
one taxable year but not in another 
taxable year. If a taxpayer produces 
transportation fuel at multiple facilities, 
the determination of whether the fuel 
was produced at a qualified facility is 
made separately for each facility. 
(ii) Section 48(a)(15) election. A 
section 48(a)(15) election is irrevocable, 
and if made, will permanently 
disqualify a facility from being a 
qualified facility for purposes of section 
45Z for the taxable year of the election 
and all subsequent taxable years. 
(iii) Carbon capture equipment at a 
facility. In the case of any transportation 
fuel produced at a facility that includes 
carbon capture equipment for which the 
section 45Q credit is allowed for the 
taxable year, that facility is not a 
qualified facility, and no section 45Z 
credit will be determined with respect 
to the facility for the taxable year. 
(3) Examples. The following examples 
illustrate the application of the anti- 
stacking rules. For purposes of these 
examples, assume that X and Y are 
unrelated C corporations and that all 
other requirements for an anti-stacking 
credit are met. 
(i) Example 1. Interaction of section 
45Z and section 45V credits; 
transportation fuel and qualified clean 
hydrogen produced at the same facility 
by persons with the same taxable year. 
During 2025 and 2026, X, a calendar 
year taxpayer, produces transportation 
fuel at a facility and sells the fuel in 
qualified sales in 2025 and 2026. X is 
otherwise eligible to claim the section 
45Z credit with respect to the 
transportation fuel it produces at the 
facility. During 2025 and 2026, Y, a 
calendar year taxpayer, produces 
qualified clean hydrogen (as defined in 
section 45V(c)(2)) at the same facility. Y 
claims and is allowed a section 45V 
credit with respect to the facility for 
2025, but not for 2026. No other person 
is allowed a section 45V credit with 
respect to the facility for 2025 or 2026. 
Because Y is allowed a section 45V 
credit with respect to the facility for 
2025, the facility is not a qualified 
facility for purposes of section 45Z for 
2025 and X is not eligible to claim a 
section 45Z credit with respect to the 
facility for 2025. Because no section 45V 
credit is allowed with respect to the 
facility for 2026, the facility is a 
qualified facility for purposes of section 
45Z for 2026. Therefore, X is eligible to 
claim a section 45Z credit with respect 
to the facility for 2026. 
(ii) Example 2. Interaction of section 
45Z and section 45V credits; 
transportation fuel and qualified clean 
hydrogen produced at the same facility 
by persons with different taxable years. 
During 2025, X, a calendar year 
taxpayer, produces transportation fuel at 
a facility and sells the fuel in a qualified 
sale. X is otherwise eligible to claim the 
section 45Z credit with respect to the 
facility. During 2025, Y produces 
qualified clean hydrogen (as defined in 
section 45V(c)(2)) at the same facility. Y 
has a taxable year of October 1 to 
September 30. Y claims and is allowed 
a section 45V credit with respect to the 
facility for its taxable year of October 1, 
2024, to September 30, 2025, but not for 
its taxable year of October 1, 2025, to 
September 30, 2026. No other person is 
allowed a section 45V credit with 
respect to the facility for any portion of 
2025. The facility is not a qualified 
facility for purposes of section 45Z for 
the period in 2025 for which Y is 
allowed a section 45V credit (that is, 
January 1 through September 30, 2025). 
However, the facility is a qualified 
facility for purposes of section 45Z for 
the period in 2025 for which no section 
45V credit is allowed with respect to the 
facility (that is, October 1 through 
December 31, 2025). Therefore, X is 
eligible to claim a section 45Z credit 
with respect to the facility for 2025, but 
only for the period during which the 
facility is a qualified facility (that is, 
October 1 through December 31, 2025). 
(iii) Example 3. Interaction of section 
45Z credit and section 48(a)(15) 
election. During 2025, X, a calendar year 
taxpayer, produces transportation fuel at 
a facility and sells the fuel in a qualified 
sale. During 2025, X also produces 
qualified clean hydrogen (as defined in 
section 45V(c)(2)) at the same facility, 
which is a specified clean hydrogen 
production facility (as defined in 
section 48(a)(15)(C)). X is otherwise 
eligible to claim the section 45Z credit 
and to make a section 48(a)(15) election 
with respect to the facility. For 2025, X 
makes an election under section 
48(a)(15) to treat the facility as energy 
property for purposes of the energy 
credit under section 48. X claims and is 
allowed the section 48 credit. Because 
the transportation fuel and the qualified 
clean hydrogen are produced at the 
same facility, and X is allowed a section 
VerDate Sep<11>2014 16:28 Feb 03, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\04FEP2.SGM 04FEP2khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS2
5200 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
48 credit attributable to a section 
48(a)(15) election with respect to the 
facility for 2025, the facility is not a 
qualified facility for purposes of section 
45Z for 2025. Because the section 
48(a)(15) election is irrevocable, the 
facility also will not be a qualified 
facility for purposes of section 45Z for 
any subsequent taxable year. Therefore, 
X is not eligible to claim the section 45Z 
credit with respect to the facility for 
2025 or for any subsequent taxable year. 
(iv) Example 4. Interaction of section 
45Z and section 45Q credits; 
transportation fuel produced at a 
facility that includes carbon capture 
equipment. During 2025 and 2026, X, a 
calendar year taxpayer, produces 
transportation fuel at a facility and sells 
the fuel in a qualified sale. X is 
otherwise eligible to claim the section 
45Z credit with respect to the facility. 
The facility includes carbon capture 
equipment (within the meaning of 
section 45Q). Y, a calendar year 
taxpayer, owns and uses the carbon 
capture equipment at the facility to 
capture carbon oxide. During 2025, Y 
utilizes or disposes of the carbon oxide 
in a manner that qualifies for the section 
45Q credit. Y claims and is allowed a 
section 45Q credit with respect to the 
facility for 2025, but not for 2026. No 
other person is allowed a section 45Q 
credit with respect to the facility for 
2025 or 2026. Because Y is allowed a 
section 45Q credit with respect to the 
facility for 2025, the facility is not a 
qualified facility for purposes of section 
45Z for 2025, and X is not eligible to 
claim a section 45Z credit with respect 
to the facility for 2025. Because no 
section 45Q credit is allowed with 
respect to the facility for 2026, the 
facility is a qualified facility for 
purposes of section 45Z for 2026. 
Therefore, X is eligible to claim a 
section 45Z credit with respect to the 
facility for 2026. 
(c) Anti-abuse rules. The rules of 
section 45Z and the section 45Z 
regulations must be applied in a manner 
consistent with the purposes of section 
45Z and the section 45Z regulations 
(and the regulations in this chapter 
under sections 6417 and 6418 related to 
the section 45Z credit). These purposes 
include incentivizing the domestic 
production and use of clean 
transportation fuel and ensuring that 
taxpayers do not circumvent the 
feedstock origin and anti-stacking rules. 
Therefore, no section 45Z credit is 
determined if a taxpayer’s primary 
purpose in producing and selling a 
transportation fuel is to obtain the 
benefit of the section 45Z credit in a 
manner that is wasteful, such as 
discarding, disposing of, or destroying 
the transportation fuel without putting 
it to a productive use. Whether the 
production and sale of transportation 
fuel is consistent with the purposes of 
section 45Z and the section 45Z 
regulations (and the regulations in this 
chapter under sections 6417 and 6418 
related to the section 45Z credit) is 
based on all facts and circumstances. 
(d) Production attributable to the 
taxpayer—(1) In general. Except as 
provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, in the case of a facility in which 
more than one person has an ownership 
interest (and the arrangement is not 
classified as a partnership for Federal 
tax purposes), production from the 
facility is allocated among those persons 
in proportion to their respective 
ownership interests in the gross sales 
from the facility. Each owner’s 
respective allocable share of the section 
45Z credit is based on each owner’s 
allocable share of production, 
determined pursuant to section 45Z and 
the section 45Z regulations. See section 
45Z(f)(2). 
(2) Example. X, Y, and Z are all 
calendar year taxpayers, and each owns 
an interest in Facility, which is a 
qualified facility. X has a 45 percent 
ownership interest in Facility, Y has a 
35 percent ownership interest in 
Facility, and Z has a 20 percent 
ownership interest in Facility. Gross 
sales from Facility are allocated among 
X, Y, and Z in proportion to their 
ownership interests. During 2025, 
Facility produced 10 million gallons of 
transportation fuel. X, Y, and Z will 
each determine the amount of their 
section 45Z credit for 2025 based on 
their allocable share of the 10 million 
gallons of transportation fuel produced 
at Facility during 2025. Thus, X will 
determine the amount of its section 45Z 
credit based on 4.5 million gallons, Y 
will determine the amount of its section 
45Z credit based on 3.5 million gallons, 
and Z will determine the amount of its 
section 45Z credit based on 2 million 
gallons. 
(3) Section 761(a) election. If a facility 
is owned through an unincorporated 
organization that has made a valid 
election under section 761(a) of the 
Code, each member’s undivided 
ownership interest in the facility will be 
treated as a separate facility owned by 
the member. 
(e) No requirement of facility 
ownership—(1) In general. A taxpayer is 
not required to own the qualified 
facility at which the taxpayer produces 
transportation fuel in order for a section 
45Z credit to be determined with 
respect to that fuel. 
(2) Application of production 
attribution rules if taxpayer does not 
own facility. If a taxpayer produces 
transportation fuel at a facility owned 
by another person, production of that 
fuel will be attributed to the taxpayer 
unless otherwise specified in the Code 
or in the section 45Z regulations. In the 
case of a production arrangement under 
which multiple taxpayers produce 
transportation fuel at a facility that is 
not owned by all those taxpayers, 
production of the transportation fuel 
will be allocated among the taxpayers in 
proportion to their respective interests 
in the gross sales from that fuel, as 
determined under the applicable 
contract or other legal arrangement with 
respect to the fuel. 
(f) Foreign feedstock and prohibited 
foreign entity restrictions—(1) Foreign 
feedstock restrictions. Transportation 
fuel that is produced after December 31, 
2025, must be exclusively derived from 
a feedstock that was produced or grown 
in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. 
See section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(iii). 
(2) Prohibited foreign entity 
restrictions—(i) Specified foreign entity. 
No section 45Z credit is determined for 
any taxable year of a taxpayer beginning 
after July 4, 2025, if the taxpayer is a 
specified foreign entity (as defined in 
section 7701(a)(51)(B) of the Code). See 
section 45Z(f)(8)(A). 
(ii) Other prohibited foreign entity. No 
section 45Z credit is determined for any 
taxable year of a taxpayer beginning 
after July 4, 2027, if the taxpayer is a 
foreign-influenced entity (as defined 
section 7701(a)(51)(D) of the Code, 
without regard to section 
7701(a)(51)(D)(i)(II)). See section 
45Z(f)(8)(B). 
(g) Recordkeeping and 
substantiation—(1) In general. A 
taxpayer claiming a section 45Z credit 
must maintain records sufficient to 
establish the taxpayer’s eligibility for 
the section 45Z credit and the amount 
of the credit claimed on the return. At 
a minimum, those records must include 
records: 
(i) Establishing that each fuel 
produced is a transportation fuel; 
(ii) Establishing any relevant 
information relating to the primary 
feedstock(s) used to produce each such 
fuel; 
(iii) Establishing that each fuel meets 
any additional specifications for the 
type of fuel described in § 1.45Z– 
1(b)(24) or (30); 
(iv) Substantiating how the emissions 
rate for each fuel was determined 
(including, if applicable, the specific 
type(s) and category(ies) under the 
applicable emissions rate table); 
(v) Relating to any fuel testing 
obtained by the taxpayer;

5201 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
(vi) Establishing that each facility 
used to produce fuel is a qualified 
facility; 
(vii) Establishing the date each facility 
was placed in service; 
(viii) Establishing that each fuel was 
sold in a qualified sale; 
(ix) Establishing any certification from 
an unrelated person and substantiating 
the information therein; and 
(x) Used for or related to any petition 
for a provisional emissions rate (PER), 
including raw data. 
(2) Safe harbor for substantiation of 
emissions rate. A taxpayer may 
substantiate the emissions rate for a 
transportation fuel which is not 
sustainable aviation fuel (non-SAF 
transportation fuel) that was determined 
using the 45ZCF–GREET model by 
obtaining certification with respect to 
that fuel in substantially the same form 
and manner described in § 1.45Z–5 for 
certifying an emissions rate for SAF 
transportation fuel determined using the 
45ZCF–GREET model. A taxpayer must 
provide the qualified certifier with all 
information necessary to provide the 
certification, as described in § 1.45Z–5. 
The Secretary may provide other 
methods through which a taxpayer may 
substantiate the emissions rate for a 
non-SAF transportation fuel. The 
Secretary will prescribe any such 
methods in guidance published in the 
Internal Revenue Bulletin or in IRS 
forms, instructions, or publications. See 
§§ 601.601 and 601.602 of this chapter. 
(3) Safe harbor for substantiation of 
qualified sale—(i) In general. A taxpayer 
may substantiate a qualified sale of 
transportation fuel by obtaining from 
the purchaser a certificate in 
substantially the same form as described 
in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section. If 
the certificate relates to a single 
purchase, the taxpayer must obtain the 
certificate from the purchaser prior to or 
at the time of sale. If the certificate 
relates to purchases made over a period 
of time, the taxpayer must obtain the 
certificate from the purchaser prior to or 
at the same time as the first of the sales 
to which the certificate relates. A 
taxpayer receiving a certificate from a 
purchaser must have no reason to 
believe that any information in the 
certificate regarding the use of the 
transportation fuel is false. The 
Secretary of the Treasury or the 
Secretary’s delegate (Secretary) may 
provide other methods through which a 
taxpayer may substantiate a qualified 
sale. The Secretary will prescribe any 
such methods in guidance published in 
the Internal Revenue Bulletin or in IRS 
forms, instructions, or publications. See 
§§ 601.601 and 601.602 of this chapter.

§ 1.45Z–5 Procedures for certification of 
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rates. 
(a) In general. This section provides 
rules on certification from an unrelated 
person for sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF) transportation fuel pursuant to 
section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the Code. 
(b) Certification requirements—(1) In 
general. For each taxable year for which 
a taxpayer claims a section 45Z credit 
for SAF transportation fuel, the taxpayer 
must obtain certification from an 
unrelated person and include such 
certification with the taxpayer’s Form 
7218, which is filed with the taxpayer’s 
Federal income tax return or Federal 
information return, for each qualified 
facility at which the taxpayer produces 
SAF transportation fuel. 
(2) Content. The certification 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section must be prepared by a qualified 
certifier and signed by the qualified 
certifier under penalty of perjury. The 
certification must contain information 
that is in substantially the same form as 
the model certification provided in 
paragraph (h) of this section and must 
contain all information necessary to 
complete the model certification. 
Specifically, the certification must 
include— 
(i) A production statement described 
in paragraph (c) of this section from the 
qualified certifier regarding the 
production of SAF transportation fuel, 
including that the inputs used to 
determine the lifecycle greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions rate of the production 
process are accurate; 
(ii) A conflict statement described in 
paragraph (d) of this section from the 
qualified certifier regarding conflicts of 
interest; 
(iii) A qualified certifier statement

certain general information about the 
qualified facility at which the SAF 
transportation fuel production 
undergoing certification occurred; 
(v) Any documentation necessary to 
substantiate the certification process 
given the standards and best practices 
prescribed by the qualified certifier’s 
accrediting body as they apply to the 
circumstances of the taxpayer and the 
qualified facility; and 
(vi) Any other information or 
documentation required by applicable 
IRS tax forms or form instructions. 
(3) Qualified certifier—(i) CORSIA 
methodologies. For taxpayers using the 
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction 
Scheme for International Aviation 
(CORSIA) Default Life Cycle Emissions 
Values for CORSIA Eligible Fuels 
lifecycle approach (CORSIA Default) or 
the CORSIA Methodology for 
Calculating Actual Life Cycle Emissions 
Values lifecycle approach (CORSIA 
Actual) to determine the emissions rate 
for SAF transportation fuel, the term 
qualified certifier means any individual 
or organization that is unrelated to the 
taxpayer and is not an employee of the 
taxpayer, and that has an active 
accreditation from International 
Sustainability and Carbon Certification, 
Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials, 
ClassNK, or other sustainability 
certification scheme approved by the 
ICAO. 
(ii) 45ZCF–GREET model. For 
taxpayers using the 45ZCF–GREET 
model to determine the emissions rate 
for SAF transportation fuel, the term 
qualified certifier means any individual 
or organization that is unrelated to the 
taxpayer and is not an employee of the 
taxpayer, and that has an active 
accreditation— 
(A) From the American National 
Standards Institute National 
Accreditation Board to conduct 
validation and verification in 
accordance with the requirements of 
International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) 14065; or 
(B) As a verifier, lead verifier, or 
verification body under the California 
Air Resources Board Low Carbon Fuel 
Standard (CARB LCFS) program. 
(iii) Qualifications are methodology 
specific. Qualified certifiers are 
qualified to provide certification only 
for the associated methodologies 
identified in this paragraph (b)(3). A 
qualified certifier must have active 
accreditation for the associated 
methodology as of the date it provides 
a certification to a taxpayer. A taxpayer 
must use the qualified certifier 
identified in this paragraph (b)(3) for the 
identified emissions rate methodology 
used by the taxpayer. 
(c) Requirements for the production 
statement. The requirements set forth in 
this paragraph (c) apply to the 
production statement required by 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. See 
section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(II)(aa). 
(1) Data accuracy. The production 
statement must be a statement that the

applies to qualified sales occurring in 
taxable years ending on or after [date of 
publication of final regulations in the 
Federal Register]. 
§ 1.45Z–6 Procedures for filing a claim for 
the clean fuel production credit. 
(a) Time and manner of filing a claim. 
To claim the section 45Z credit, a 
taxpayer must include a completed 
Form 7218 with the taxpayer’s timely 
filed (including extensions) Federal 
income tax return or Federal 
information return for the taxable year 
for which the taxpayer is claiming the 
section 45Z credit. A separate Form 
7218 is required for each qualified 
facility at which transportation fuel for 
which the taxpayer is claiming the 
section 45Z credit is produced. A 
taxpayer must complete Form 7218 in 
accordance with the instructions to that 
form and provide all information 
required by the form and instructions. A 
taxpayer must include with its Form 
7218 any applicable certification 
required by § 1.45Z–5. 
(b) Proper claimant—(1) In general. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, only a taxpayer that is 
registered by the IRS as a producer of 
transportation fuel at the time of 
production may claim the section 45Z 
credit. See section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) of 
the Code. See § 1.4101–1 for rules 
related to registration, including the 
activity letters, under which producers 
of transportation fuel must be registered 
to claim the section 45Z credit. 
(2) Special rules—(i) Producer is a 
disregarded entity. If a taxpayer owns an 
entity that is disregarded as an entity 
separate from its owner within the 
meaning of § 301.7701–2(c)(2)(i) of this 
chapter (disregarded entity) that 
produces transportation fuel, and such 
disregarded entity is registered as a 
producer of transportation fuel at the 
time of production, the taxpayer that 
owns the disregarded entity is treated as 
the registered producer for purposes of 
claiming the section 45Z credit. The 
registration number (within the meaning 
of section 45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) and 
§ 1.4101–1) of that disregarded entity is 
attributed to the taxpayer. A taxpayer 
claiming a section 45Z credit with 
respect to transportation fuel produced 
by a disregarded entity that it owns 
must satisfy the recordkeeping 
requirements in § 1.45Z–4(g)(1). 
(ii) Producer is a qualified subchapter 
S subsidiary. If a taxpayer owns an 
entity that is a qualified subchapter S 
subsidiary within the meaning of 
section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code (QSub) 
that produces transportation fuel, and 
such QSub is registered as a producer of 
transportation fuel at the time of 
production, the taxpayer that owns the 
QSub is treated as the registered 
producer for purposes of claiming the 
section 45Z credit. The registration 
number (within the meaning of section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) and § 1.4101–1) of that 
QSub is attributed to the taxpayer. A 
taxpayer claiming a section 45Z credit 
with respect to transportation fuel 
produced by a QSub that it owns must 
satisfy the recordkeeping requirements 
in § 1.45Z–4(g)(1). 
(iii) Producer is a member of a 
consolidated group. If a member of a 
consolidated group (as defined in 
§ 1.1502–1(b) and (h), respectively) that 
produces transportation fuel is 
registered as a producer of 
transportation fuel at the time of 
production, the agent for such 
consolidated group is treated as the 
registered producer for purposes of 
claiming the section 45Z credit on the 
group’s return. The registration number 
(within the meaning of section 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I) and § 1.4101–1) of the 
member is attributed to the agent when 
claiming the section 45Z credit. The 
member producing the transportation 
fuel must satisfy all applicable 
requirements of section 45Z and the 
section 45Z regulations. For rules 
applicable to the agent for a 
consolidated group (generally the 
common parent), see § 1.1502–77. 
(c) Applicability date. This section 
applies to qualified sales occurring in 
taxable years ending on or after [date of 
publication of final regulations in the 
Federal Register]. 
§ 1.1361–4 [Amended] 
■ Par. 4. Section 1.1361–4 is amended 
by removing the comma after the 
language ‘‘and (a)(9) of this section’’ in 
paragraph (a)(1) and adding ‘‘and in 
§ 1.4101–1(a)(3)(iii),’’ in its place. 
■ Par. 5. Section 1.4101–1 is added to 
read as follows: 
§ 1.4101–1 Registration. 
(a) In general—(1) Overview. This 
section provides rules relating to 
registration for purposes of the section 
45Z credit. See sections 4101(a)(1) and 
45Z(f)(1)(A)(i)(I). 
(2) Letter of Registration required. A 
person is registered under section 4101 
of the Code for purposes of the section 
45Z credit only if the IRS has issued a 
Letter of Registration to the person 
under activity letter CN (in the case of 
a producer of transportation fuel which 
is not sustainable aviation fuel (non- 
SAF transportation fuel)), or activity 
letter CA (in the case of a producer of 
SAF transportation fuel), or such other 
activity letter(s) as the IRS may 
designate, and the registration has not 
been revoked or suspended. A person 
with a Letter of Registration from the 
IRS under any other activity letter is not 
registered under section 4101 for 
purposes of the section 45Z credit. 
(3) Separate entity treatment—(i) In 
general. Each business unit that has, or 
is required to have, a separate employer 
identification number (EIN) is treated as 
a separate person for purposes of 
registration under this section. Thus, 
two business units (for example, a 
parent corporation and a subsidiary 
corporation), each of which has a 
different EIN, are two persons. 
(ii) Disregarded entity. Section 
301.7701–2(c)(2)(i) of this chapter 
(relating to certain wholly owned 
entities) does not apply for purposes of 
registration under this section. An entity 
that is disregarded as an entity separate 
from its owner for any purpose under 
§ 301.7701–2 of this chapter and that 
has, or is required to have, an EIN is 
treated as a corporation (consistent with 
§ 301.7701–2(c)(2)(v)(B) of this chapter) 
for purposes of registration under this 
section. Therefore, if such an entity 
produces transportation fuel, it must be 
registered as a producer of 
transportation fuel at the time of 
production for its owner to be eligible 
to claim the section 45Z credit for such 
fuel. 
(iii) Qualified subchapter S 
subsidiary. A qualified subchapter S 
subsidiary as defined in section 
1361(b)(3)(B) of the Code (QSub) is 
treated as separate from the S 
corporation that owns it for purposes of 
registration under this section.

5205 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
Therefore, a QSub that has an EIN and 
that produces transportation fuel must 
be registered as a producer of 
transportation fuel at the time of 
production in order for its S corporation 
owner to be eligible to claim the section 
45Z credit for such fuel. 
(4) Reregistration—(i) Reregistration 
in the event of change of ownership. As 
provided in section 4101(a)(5), a person 
is required to reregister under this 
section if after a transaction (or series of 
related transactions) more than 50 
percent of ownership interests in, or 
assets of, such person are held by 
persons other than persons (or persons 
related thereto) who held more than 50 
percent of such interests or assets before 
the transaction (or series of related 
transactions). Reregistration does not 
apply to a company whose stock is 
regularly traded on an established 
securities market. 
(ii) Reregistration in the event of 
change of EIN. If a registrant changes its 
EIN, such registrant must reregister 
under this section using its new EIN. 
(iii) Safe harbor. A person that is 
required to reregister as a producer of 
transportation fuel due to a change in 
ownership or EIN is eligible to claim a 
section 45Z credit (provided that all 
requirements of section 45Z are met) as 
of the date the IRS received the 
application for reregistration, even if, at 
the time of fuel production, the IRS has 
not yet approved the reregistration. 
Provided the registration tests for the 
reregistration are met, the original 
registration remains in effect until the 
IRS revokes that registration and issues 
a new one. 
(b) Definitions—(1) Applicant. An 
applicant is a person that has applied 
for registration as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section. 
(2) Letter of Registration. A Letter of 
Registration is a letter issued by the IRS 
to approve a registration required under 
section 4101. A Letter of Registration 
includes the registrant’s registration 
number and the effective date of the 
registration. 
(3) Penalized for a wrongful act. A 
person has been penalized for a 
wrongful act if the person has— 
(i) Been assessed any penalty under 
chapter 68 of the Code (or similar 
provision of the law of any State) for 
fraudulently failing to file any return or 
pay any tax, and the penalty has not 
been wholly abated, refunded, or 
credited; 
(ii) Been assessed any penalty under 
chapter 68 of the Code, and such 
penalty has not been wholly abated, 
refunded, or credited, and the IRS 
determines that the conduct resulting in 
the penalty is part of a consistent 
pattern of failing to deposit, pay, or pay 
over a substantial amount of tax; 
(iii) Been convicted of a crime under 
chapter 75 of the Code (or similar 
provision of the law of any State), or of 
conspiracy to commit such a crime, and 
the conviction has not been wholly 
reversed by a court of competent 
jurisdiction; 
(iv) Been convicted, under the laws of 
the United States or any State, of a 
felony for which an element of the 
offense is theft, fraud, or the making of 
false statements, and the conviction has 
not been wholly reversed by a court of 
competent jurisdiction; 
(v) Been assessed any tax under 
section 4103 of the Code and the tax has 
not been wholly abated, refunded, or 
credited; or 
(vi) Had its registration under section 
4101, section 4222, section 4662, or 
section 4682 of the Code revoked. 
(4) Related person. For purposes of 
registration under section 4101 and this 
section, a related person is a person 
that— 
(i) Directly or indirectly exercises 
control over an activity of the applicant; 
(ii) Owns, directly or indirectly, five 
percent or more of the applicant; 
(iii) Is under a duty to assure the 
payment of a tax for which the applicant 
is responsible; 
(iv) Is a member, with the applicant, 
of a group of organizations (as defined 
in § 1.52–1(b)) that would be treated as 
a group of trades or businesses under 
common control for purposes of § 1.52– 
1; or 
(v) Distributed or transferred assets to 
the applicant in a transaction in which 
the applicant’s basis in the assets is 
determined by reference to the basis of 
the assets in the hands of the distributor 
or transferor. 
(5) Registrant. A registrant is a person 
that the IRS has, in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section, 
registered under section 4101 and 
whose registration has not been revoked 
or suspended. 
(c) Requirement to register—(1) In 
general. Every person producing a 
transportation fuel is required to register 
with the IRS in accordance with this 
section. See section 4101(a)(1). 
(2) Consequences of failing to register. 
For the criminal penalty imposed for 
failure to register, see section 7232 of 
the Code. For the civil penalties 
imposed for failure to register or 
reregister, see sections 6719 and 7272 of 
the Code. 
(d) Application instructions. 
Application for registration under 
section 4101 must be made on Form 
637, Application for Registration (For 
Certain Excise Tax Activities), or such 
other form as the IRS may designate, in 
accordance with the instructions to such 
form. See §
601.602 of this chapter. An 
applicant for registration as a producer 
of non-SAF transportation fuel must 
apply for registration under activity 
letter CN, or such other activity letter as 
the IRS may designate. An applicant for 
registration as a producer of SAF 
transportation fuel must apply for 
registration under activity letter CA, or 
such other activity letter as the IRS may 
designate. 
(e) Registration tests—(1) In general. 
The IRS will register an applicant only 
if the IRS determines that the applicant 
meets the following three tests 
(collectively, the registration tests): 
(i) The activity test; 
(ii) The acceptable risk test; and 
(iii) The satisfactory tax history test. 
(2) Activity test. An applicant meets 
the activity test only if the IRS 
determines that the applicant— 
(i) Is, in the course of its trade or 
business, regularly engaged in the 
activity for which it is requesting 
registration; or 
(ii) Is likely to be (because of such 
factors as the applicant’s business 
experience, financial standing, or trade 
connections), in the course of its trade 
or business, regularly engaged in the 
activity for which it is requesting 
registration within 6 months after 
becoming registered under section 4101. 
(3) Acceptable risk test—(i) In general. 
An applicant meets the acceptable risk 
test if neither the applicant nor a related 
person (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section) has been penalized for a 
wrongful act. If an applicant or a related 
person has been penalized for a 
wrongful act, the IRS may nonetheless 
determine that an applicant meets the 
acceptable risk test based on 
consideration of the factors enumerated 
in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. 
(ii) Factors to consider. In making the 
determination described in paragraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this section, the IRS may 
consider factors such as the following: 
(A) The time elapsed since the 
applicant or related person was 
penalized for a wrongful act. 
(B) The present relationship between 
the applicant and any related person 
that was penalized for any wrongful act. 
(C) The degree of rehabilitation of the 
person penalized for any wrongful act. 
(4) Satisfactory tax history test—(i) In 
general. An applicant meets the 
satisfactory tax history test only if the 
IRS determines that the applicant has a 
satisfactory tax history as described in 
paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. 
(ii) Satisfactory tax history. An 
applicant has a satisfactory tax history 
only if the Commissioner determines

5206 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
that the filing, deposit, and payment 
history for all Federal taxes of the 
applicant and any related person (as 
defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section) supports the conclusion that 
the applicant will comply with its 
obligations under this section. 
(f) Action on the application for 
registration by the IRS—(1) Review of 
application. The IRS may investigate the 
accuracy and completeness of any 
representations made by an applicant 
and request any additional relevant 
information from the applicant. 
(2) Denial. If the IRS determines that 
an applicant does not meet all the 
registration tests described in paragraph 
(e) of this section, the IRS will notify the 
applicant, in writing, that its application 
for registration is denied and state the 
basis for the denial. 
(3) Approval. If the IRS determines 
that an applicant meets all the 
registration tests described in paragraph 
(e) of this section, the IRS will register 
the applicant under section 4101 and 
issue the applicant a Letter of 
Registration that includes the effective 
date of the registration and the 
appropriate activity letter(s). A copy of 
an application for registration (Form 
637) is not a Letter of Registration. 
(g) Terms and conditions of 
registration—(1) Affirmative duties. 
Each applicant or registrant must— 
(i) Make deposits, file returns, and 
pay taxes as required by the Code and 
the regulations; 
(ii) Keep records sufficient to show 
production of a transportation fuel; 
(iii) Notify the IRS of any change in 
the information the registrant submitted 
in connection with its application for 
registration or previously submitted 
under this paragraph (g)(1)(iii) within 10 
days after the change occurs. Changes 
requiring IRS notification include, but 
are not limited to, changes in 
ownership, address, and business 
activities. 
(2) Prohibited actions. An applicant or 
registrant may not— 
(i) Sell, lease, or otherwise allow 
another person to use its registration, 
except as otherwise provided in 
§ 1.45Z–6(b)(2); or 
(ii) Make any false statement to the 
IRS in connection with a submission 
under section 4101. 
(h) Effect of Letter of Registration. A 
Letter of Registration is not a 
determination of liability for tax, 
eligibility for a tax credit or deduction, 
or any other tax treatment under the 
Code. For example, a Letter of 
Registration issued under activity letter 
CN to a person producing a fuel is not 
a determination that such fuel is a 
transportation fuel under section 
45Z(d)(5)(A) or that the facility at which 
the person produces such fuel is a 
qualified facility under section 
45Z(d)(4). A Letter of Registration is also 
not a determination letter, as defined in 
§ 601.201(a)(3) of this chapter. 
(i) Adverse actions by the IRS against 
a registrant—(1) Mandatory revocation 
or suspension. The IRS will revoke or 
suspend the registration of any 
registrant if the IRS determines that the 
registrant, at any time— 
(i) Does not meet one or more of the 
registration tests in paragraph (e) of this 
section and has not corrected the 
deficiency within a reasonable period of 
time after notification by the IRS; 
(ii) Has used its registration to evade, 
or attempt to evade, the payment of any 
tax, or to postpone or in any manner to 
interfere with the collection of any such 
tax, or to make a fraudulent claim for a 
credit or payment; 
(iii) Has aided or abetted another 
person in evading, or attempting to 
evade, payment of any tax, or in making 
a fraudulent claim for a credit or 
payment; or 
(iv) Has sold, leased, or otherwise 
allowed another person to use its 
registration, except as otherwise 
provided in § 1.45Z–6(b)(2). 
(2) Remedial action permitted in other 
cases. If the IRS determines that a 
registrant has, at any time, failed to 
comply with the terms and conditions 
of registration in paragraph (g) of this 
section, made a false statement to the 
IRS in connection with its application 
for registration (or reregistration) or for 
retention of registration, or otherwise 
used its registration in a manner that 
creates a significant risk of nonpayment 
or late payment of tax, then the IRS may 
revoke or suspend the registrant’s 
registration. 
(3) Action by the IRS to revoke or 
suspend a registration. If the IRS 
revokes or suspends a registration, the 
IRS will notify the registrant in writing 
and state the basis for the revocation or 
suspension and the activity letter(s) to 
which the revocation or suspension 
relates. The effective date of the 
revocation or suspension may not be 
earlier than the date on which the IRS 
notifies the registrant. 
(j) Applicability date. This section 
applies to persons producing 
transportation fuel in taxable years 
ending on or after [date of publication 
of final regulations in the Federal 
Register]. 
■ Par. 6. Section 1.6417–2 is amended 
by revising paragraphs (c)(4) and (f) to 
read as follows: 
§ 1.6417–2 Rules for elective payment 
elections. 
* * * * * 
(c) * * * 
(4) Credits must be determined with 
respect to the applicable entity or 
electing taxpayer. Any credits for which 
an elective payment election is made 
must have been determined with respect 
to the applicable entity or electing 
taxpayer. An applicable credit is 
determined with respect to an 
applicable entity or electing taxpayer if 
the applicable entity or electing 
taxpayer owns the underlying 
applicable credit property and conducts 
the activities giving rise to the credit or, 
if ownership is not required to give rise 
to the applicable credit, such as a credit 
under section 45Z or section 45(d)(3)(C), 
the applicable entity or electing 
taxpayer must conduct the activities 
giving rise to the credit. In the case of 
section 45X (under which ownership of 
applicable credit property is also not 
required, but for which rules related to 
contract manufacturing arrangements 
may be applicable), the applicable entity 
or electing taxpayer must be considered 
(under the section 45X regulations) the 
taxpayer with respect to which the 
section 45X credit is determined. Thus, 
no election may be made under this 
section for any credits transferred 
pursuant to section 6418, allowed 
pursuant to section 45Q(f)(3), acquired 
by a lessee from a lessor by means of an 
election to pass through the credit to a 
lessee under former section 48(d) 
(pursuant to section 50(d)(5)), owned by 
a third party, or otherwise not 
determined with respect to the 
applicable entity or electing taxpayer. 
* * * * * 
(f) Applicability dates—(1) In general. 
Except as otherwise provided in this 
paragraph (f), this section applies to 
taxable years ending on or after March 
11, 2024. For taxable years ending 
before March 11, 2024, taxpayers, 
however, may choose to apply the rules 
of §§ 1.6417–1 through 1.6417–4 and 
1.6417–6, provided the taxpayers apply 
the rules in their entirety and in a 
consistent manner. 
(2) Paragraph (c)(4). Paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section applies to taxable years 
ending on or after [date of publication 
of final regulations in the Federal 
Register]. For taxable years ending 
before [date of publication of final 
regulations in the Federal Register], see 
§ 1.6417–2(c)(4) as contained in 26 CFR 
part 1, revised April 1, 2025. 
■ Par. 7. Section 1.6418–2 is amended 
by revising paragraphs (d)(1) and (g) to 
read as follows:

5207 Federal Register / Vol. 91, No. 23 / Wednesday, February 4, 2026 / Proposed Rules 
§ 1.6418–2 Rules for making transfer 
elections. 
* * * * * 
(d) Determining the eligible credit— 
(1) In general. An eligible taxpayer may 
only transfer eligible credits determined 
with respect to the eligible taxpayer 
(paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
disallows transfer elections in other 
situations). An eligible credit is 
determined with respect to an eligible 
taxpayer if the eligible taxpayer owns 
the underlying eligible credit property 
and conducts the activities giving rise to 
the credit or, if ownership is not 
required to give rise to the eligible 
credit, such as a credit under section 
45Z or section 45(d)(3)(C), the eligible 
taxpayer must conduct the activities 
giving rise to the credit. In the case of 
section 45X (under which ownership of 
eligible credit property is also not 
required, but for which rules related to 
contract manufacturing arrangements 
may be applicable), the eligible taxpayer 
must be considered (under the section 
45X regulations) the taxpayer with 
respect to which the section 45X credit 
is determined. All rules that relate to the 
determination of the eligible credit, 
such as the rules in sections 49 and 
50(b) of the Code, apply to the eligible 
taxpayer and therefore can limit the 
amount of eligible credit determined 
with respect to an eligible credit 
property that can be transferred. Rules 
relating to the amount of an eligible 
credit that is allowed to be claimed by 
an eligible taxpayer, such as the rules in 
section 38(c) or section 469 of the Code, 
do not limit the eligible credit 
determined, but do apply to a transferee 
taxpayer as described in paragraph (f)(3) 
of this section. 
* * * * * 
(g) Applicability dates—(1) In general. 
Except as otherwise provided in this 
paragraph (g), this section applies to 
taxable years ending on or after April 
30, 2024. For taxable years ending 
before April 30, 2024, taxpayers, 
however, may choose to apply the rules 
of this section and §§ 1.6418–1, 1.6418– 
3, and 1.6418–5, provided the taxpayers 
apply the rules in their entirety and in 
a consistent manner. 
(2) Paragraph (d)(1). Paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section applies to taxable years 
ending on or after [date of publication 
of final regulations in the Federal 
Register]. For taxable years ending 
before [date of publication of final 
regulations in the Federal Register], see 
§ 1.6418–2(d)(1) as contained in 26 CFR 
part 1, revised April 1, 2025. 
PART 48—MANUFACTURERS AND 
RETAILERS EXCISE TAXES 
■ Par. 8. The authority citation for part 
48 continues to read in part as follows: 
Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * * 
* * * * * 
Section 48.4101–1 also issued under 26 
U.S.C. 4101(a)(1). 
* * * * * 
■ Par. 9. Section 48.4101–1 is amended 
by adding paragraphs (a)(7) and (8), and 
(l)(6), to read as follows: 
§ 48.4101–1 Taxable fuel; registration. 
* * * * * 
(a) * * * 
(7) A letter of registration is not a 
determination of liability for tax, 
eligibility for a tax credit or deduction, 
or any other tax treatment under the 
Code. For example, a registration letter 
issued under activity letter SA to a 
person producing or importing a fuel 
that may be eligible for a credit under 
section 6426(k) of the Code is not a 
determination that such fuel qualifies 
for the section 6426(k) credit. A letter of 
registration is also not a determination 
letter, as defined in § 601.201(a)(3) of 
this chapter. The terms letter of 
registration and registration letter as 
used in this section have the same 
meaning as the term Letter of 
Registration as defined in § 1.4101– 
1(b)(2) of this chapter. 
(8) A person is required to reregister 
under this section if after a transaction 
(or series of related transactions) more 
than 50 percent of ownership interests 
in, or assets of, such person are held by 
persons other than persons (or persons 
related thereto) who held more than 50 
percent of such interests or assets before 
the transaction (or series of related 
transactions). Reregistration does not 
apply to any company whose stock is 
regularly traded on an established 
securities market. If a registrant changes 
its employer identification number 
(EIN), such registrant must reregister 
under this section using its new EIN. 
* * * * * 
(l) * * * 
(6) Paragraphs (a)(7) and (8) of this 
section apply to taxable years ending on 
or after [date of publication of final 
regulations in the Federal Register].
