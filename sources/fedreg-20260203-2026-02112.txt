Filing of Proposed Rule Change To 
Enhance the Correlation Calculation 
for Bond Haircut Models and Make 
Other Changes 
January 29, 2026. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)
1 and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,2 
notice is hereby given that on January 
27, 2026, Fixed Income Clearing 
Corporation (‘‘FICC’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II and III 
below, which Items have been prepared 
by the clearing agency. The Commission 
is publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Terms of Substance of the Proposed 
Rule Change 
The proposed rule change
3 consists of 
amendments to the Methodology 
Document—GSD Initial Market Risk 
Margin Model (‘‘QRM Methodology 
Document’’)
4 in order to enhance the 
correlation calculation for bond haircut 
models. In addition, FICC is proposing 
a technical change to the QRM 
Methodology Document. 
FICC is requesting confidential 
treatment of the QRM Methodology 
Document and has filed it separately 
with the Secretary of the Commission.

II. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
clearing agency included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
clearing agency has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, 
and C below, of the most significant 
aspects of such statements. 
(A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
1. Purpose 
The purpose of this proposed rule 
change is to amend the QRM 
Methodology Document in order to 
enhance the correlation calculation for 
bond haircut models. FICC is also 
proposing to make a technical change to 
the QRM Methodology Document. 
Background 
FICC, through GSD, serves as a central 
counterparty and provider of clearance 
and settlement services for transactions 
in U.S. government securities, as well as 
repurchase and reverse repurchase 
transactions involving U.S. government 
securities. GSD also clears and settles 
certain transactions on securities issued 
or guaranteed by U.S. government 
agencies and government sponsored 
enterprises. As part of its market risk 
management strategy, FICC manages its 
credit exposure to Members by 
determining the appropriate Required 
Fund Deposit to the Clearing Fund and 
monitoring its sufficiency, as provided 
for in the GSD Rules.
6 The Required 
Fund Deposit serves as each Member’s 
margin. 
The objective of a Member’s Required 
Fund Deposit is to mitigate potential 
losses to FICC associated with 
liquidating a Member’s portfolio in the 
event FICC ceases to act for that Member 
(hereinafter referred to as a ‘‘default’’).
7 
The aggregate amount of all Members’ 
Required Fund Deposits constitutes the 
Clearing Fund. FICC would access the 
Clearing Fund should a defaulting 
Member’s own Required Fund Deposit 
be insufficient to satisfy losses to FICC 
caused by the liquidation of that 
Member’s portfolio. 
At GSD, each Member is also 
responsible for the margin obligations 
arising from the activity of the Member’s 
indirect participant customers 
submitted to FICC via the sponsored 
membership service (‘‘Sponsored 
Service’’) and/or the Agent Clearing 
Service. FICC’s Sponsored Service 
permits Members that are approved to 
be Sponsoring Members, to sponsor 
certain institutional firms, referred to as 
‘‘Sponsored Members,’’ into GSD 
membership.
8 FICC establishes and 
maintains a ‘‘Sponsoring Member 
Omnibus Account’’ on its books in 
which it records the transactions of the 
Sponsoring Member’s Sponsored 
Members (‘‘Sponsored Member 
Trades’’).
9 Similarly, FICC’s Agent 
Clearing Service permits Members that 
are approved to be Agent Clearing 
Members to submit activities of certain 
institutional firms, referred to as 
‘‘Executing Firm Customers,’’ into FICC 
for clearing and settlement.
10 FICC 
establishes and maintains an ‘‘Agent 
Clearing Member Omnibus Account’’ on 
its books in which it records the 
transactions of the Agent Clearing

Transactions’’), supra note 3. 
12 See GSD Margin Component Schedule, supra 
note 3. 
13 Supra note 3. 
14 These margin components and the relevant 
defined terms are located in GSD Rule 1 
(Definitions) and/or the GSD Margin Component 
Schedule, supra note 3. 
15 During the initial methodology development, 
the overall impact to the haircut charge due to 
correlations was expected to be limited. 
Consequently, when vendor index data is 
unavailable, correlations for Treasury 0–6 months, 
Treasury 6–12 months, and TIPS 0–12 months 
maturity buckets are set to zero. The decision to set 
such correlations to zero is intended to provide a 
clear and consistent framework for margin 
calculation, pending the availability of reliable 
index data from external vendors. 
16 FICC can deploy Margin Proxy as a back-up 
VaR Charge calculation in the event that FICC 
experiences a data disruption with its third-party 
vendor. See GSD Margin Component Schedule 
(definition of ‘‘Margin Proxy’’), supra note 3. 
Member’s Executing Firm Customers 
(‘‘Agent Clearing Transactions’’).11 
Both the Sponsoring Members and the 
Agent Clearing Members have the 
option of segregating Sponsored 
Member Trades of a Sponsored Member 
and Agent Clearing Transactions of an 
Executing Firm Customer, as applicable, 
in separate accounts (i.e., Segregated 
Indirect Participants Accounts), each 
such Sponsored Member and Executing 
Firm Customer being referred to as a 
‘‘Segregated Indirect Participant.’’ FICC 
manages its credit exposure to 
Segregated Indirect Participants by 
determining the appropriate Segregated 
Customer Margin Requirement and 
monitoring its sufficiency, as provided 
for in the GSD Rules.
12 
Pursuant to the GSD Rules, each 
Member’s Required Fund Deposit 
amount (and Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirement amount, to the 
extent applicable) consists of a number 
of components, each of which is 
calculated to address specific risks faced 
by FICC, as identified within the GSD 
Rules.
13 At GSD, these components 
include the VaR Charge, Blackout 
Period Exposure Adjustment, 
Backtesting Charge, Excess Capital 
Premium, Holiday Charge, Intraday 
Supplemental Fund Deposit, Intraday 
Mark-to-Market Charge, Margin 
Liquidity Adjustment Charge, Portfolio 
Differential Charge, Volatility Event 
Charge, and special charge.
14 The VaR 
Charge generally comprises the largest 
portion of a Member’s Required Fund 
Deposit and Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirement amounts. 
The VaR Charge is based on the 
potential price volatility of unsettled 
positions using a sensitivity-based 
Value-at-Risk (‘‘sensitivity VaR’’) 
methodology and is designed to cover 
FICC’s projected liquidation losses with 
respect to a defaulted Member’s 
portfolio at a 99% confidence level. The 
sensitivity VaR methodology provides 
an estimate of the possible losses for a 
given portfolio based on: (1) confidence 
level, (2) a time horizon, and (3) 
historical market volatility. FICC uses 
historical simulation to estimate the 
impact of market volatilities on the 
Member’s portfolio. A haircut method is 
applied to securities with insufficient 
requisite data used to employ the 
sensitivity VaR approach, e.g., short- 
term bonds. 
Enhancing the Correlation Calculation 
for Bond Haircut Models 
The QRM Methodology Document 
provides the methodologies by which 
FICC calculates the VaR Charge, i.e., 
sensitivity VaR methodology and 
haircut methodology. Specifically, the 
QRM Methodology Document provides 
model inputs, parameters, and 
assumptions, among other information, 
for these methodologies. 
Pursuant to the QRM Methodology 
Document, all short-term bonds (i.e., 
bonds with maturity of one-year or less) 
(including Treasury Inflation Protected 
Securities (‘‘TIPS’’)) and bonds with no 
vendor provided sensitivity analytics 
data are subject to a haircut calculation. 
The haircut charges are calculated by 
placing the bonds into relevant maturity 
buckets, using correlations to account 
for cross-bucket effects. The correlations 
are calculated based on fixed income 
indices provided by a designated 
vendor. However, because the 
designated vendor does not currently 
provide index data for Treasury 0–6 
months, Treasury 6–12 months, and 
TIPS 0–12 months maturity buckets, the 
correlations involving any of these three 
maturity buckets are manually set by 
FICC to zero.
15 Setting the correlation to 
zero for Treasury 0–6 months, Treasury 
6–12 months, and TIPS 0–12 months 
maturity buckets may result in 
understated haircut charges. This is 
particularly true for directional 
portfolios with securities in adjacent 
maturity buckets, for example, one bond 
with 5 months to maturity and another 
with 7 months to maturity, because 
historical evidence shows short-term 
maturity buckets are substantially 
intercorrelated. To strengthen FICC’s 
assessment of market risk for portfolios 
with bond positions in maturity buckets 
where the designated vendor does not 
provide index data, FICC proposes to 
enhance the correlation calculation for 
bond haircut models by permitting the 
use of index data from an alternate 
vendor in such cases. 
FICC is proposing modifications to 
the QRM Methodology Document in 
order to enhance the correlation 
calculation for bond haircut models. 
Specifically, in the subsection of the 
QRM Methodology Document that 
describes calculation of haircut of 
Treasury and agency bonds without 
sensitivity analytics data, FICC would 
delete existing language regarding 
correlation parameter alternatives and 
replace it with new language to make it 
clear that, for fixed income indices not 
provided by the designated vendor, 
FICC may use data from another vendor 
to calculate the correlation. In addition, 
FICC would delete existing language 
that describes the current practice of 
assuming zero correlation for certain 
maturity buckets of short-term bonds. 
Furthermore, FICC is also proposing a 
technical change that corrects a section 
reference. 
Impact Study 
FICC performed an impact study for 
the period beginning September 1, 2024 
through August 31, 2025 (‘‘Impact Study 
Period’’), looking at Treasury 0–6 
months, Treasury 6–12 months, and 
TIPS 0–12 months maturity buckets 
with a different correlation number than 
zero calculated based on index data 
provided by an alternate vendor. If the 
proposed rule change had been in place 
during the Impact Study Period 
compared to the existing GSD Rules, the 
average increase to the aggregate VaR 
Charges at GSD would be approximately 
$46 million (or 0.09%), with the largest 
increase of approximately $85 million 
(or 0.15%). The impact study indicated 
that, if the proposed rule change had 
been in place, the VaR model 
backtesting coverage would have 
remained unchanged at 99.85%. 
Margin Proxy was not deployed 
during the Impact Study Period;
16 
however, if the proposed rule change 
had been in place and Margin Proxy 
were deployed during the Impact Study 
Period, the average increase to the 
aggregate VaR Charges at GSD would be 
approximately $88 million (or 0.16%), 
with the largest increase of 
approximately $163 million (or 0.38%). 
The impact study indicated that, if the 
proposed rule change had been in place 
and Margin Proxy were deployed during 
the Impact Study Period, the VaR model 
backtesting coverage would have 
remained unchanged at 99.92%.

average, at the Member Margin Portfolio 
level, the proposed rule change would 
have increased the start of day (‘‘SOD’’) 
VaR Charge by approximately $0.22 
million, or 0.09%, over the Impact 
Study Period. The largest average 
percentage increase in SOD VaR Charge 
for any Member Margin Portfolio would 
have been approximately 14.52%, or

increase in SOD VaR Charge for any 
Member Margin Portfolio would have 
been approximately $5.91 million, or

Period, on average, at the Member 
Margin Portfolio level, the proposed 
rule change would have increased the 
SOD VaR Charge by approximately 
$0.42 million, or 0.16% over the Impact 
Study Period. The largest average 
percentage increase in SOD VaR Charge 
for any Member Margin Portfolio would 
have been approximately 23.18%, or 
$0.59 million. The largest average dollar 
increase in SOD VaR Charge for any 
Member Margin Portfolio would have 
been approximately $17.35 million, or 
0.34%. 
2. Statutory Basis 
FICC believes this proposal is 
consistent with the requirements of the 
Act, and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to a registered 
clearing agency. Specifically, FICC 
believes that the proposed rule change 
is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) 
of the Act
17 and Rules 17ad–22(e)(4)(i) 
and (e)(6)(i) promulgated thereunder 18 
for the reasons described below. 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act 
requires that the rules of a clearing 
agency be designed to, among other 
things, assure the safeguarding of 
securities and funds which are in the 
custody or control of the clearing 
agency.
19 FICC believes the proposed 
change to enhance the correlation 
calculation for bond haircut models is 
designed to assure the safeguarding of 
securities and funds which are in its 
custody or control because it is designed 
to mitigate FICC’s risk exposure from 
bond positions held in Members’ 
portfolios. Specifically, the proposed 
enhancement would allow FICC to 
collect financial resources to mitigate 
credit risk exposure resulting from 
bonds held in Members’ portfolios. 
The Clearing Fund/Segregated 
Customer Margin is a key tool that FICC 
uses to mitigate potential losses to FICC 
associated with liquidating a Member’s 
portfolio in the event of Member 
default. Therefore, the proposed change 
to enhance the correlation calculation 
for bond haircut models would enable 
FICC to better address credit risk 
exposure resulting from bonds held in 
Members’ portfolios such that, in the 
event of a Member default, FICC’s 
operations would not be disrupted, and 
non-defaulting Members would not be 
exposed to losses they cannot anticipate 
or control. In this way, the proposed 
change to enhance the correlation 
calculation for bond haircut models 
would assure the safeguarding of 
securities and funds which are in the 
custody or control of FICC, consistent 
with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
20 
FICC believes the proposed change to 
make a technical change to the QRM 
Methodology Document would enhance 
the accuracy of the QRM Methodology 
Document for FICC. The QRM 
Methodology Document is used by FICC 
risk management personnel for the 
calculation of margin requirements. 
Having an accurate QRM Methodology 
Document will help facilitate the 
accurate and smooth functioning of the 
margining process at FICC. The 
proposed technical change would 
promote such accuracy. This would in 
turn enable FICC risk management to 
assess an appropriate level of margin for 
Members. As such, FICC believes that 
the proposed technical change to the 
QRM Methodology Document would 
assure the safeguarding of securities and 
funds which are in the custody or 
control of FICC, consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
21 
The proposed change to enhance the 
correlation calculation for bond haircut 
models has also been designed to be 
consistent with Rules 17ad–22(e)(4)(i) 
and (e)(6)(i) under the Act.
22 Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(4)(i) under the Act requires a 
covered clearing agency to establish, 
implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to effectively 
identify, measure, monitor, and manage 
its credit exposures to participants and 
those exposures arising from its 
payment, clearing, and settlement 
processes by maintaining sufficient 
financial resources to cover its credit 
exposure to each participant fully with 
a high degree of confidence.
23 As 
described above, the proposed change to 
permit the use of index data from an 
alternate vendor when the designated 
vendor does not provide such data 
would enhance the correlation 
calculation for bond haircut models, 
which in turn would help address the 
identification, measurement, monitoring 
and management of credit exposures 
that may arise from bonds held in 
Members’ portfolios. By enhancing the 
correlation calculation for bond haircut 
models, the proposed change would 
enable FICC to have rule provisions that 
are reasonably designed to effectively 
identify, measure, monitor, and manage 
its credit exposures to Members and 
those exposures arising from its 
payment, clearing, and settlement 
processes, which FICC believes is 
consistent with Rule 17ad–22(e)(4)(i). 
Moreover, the proposed change would 
enable FICC to better identify, measure, 
monitor, and, through the collection of 
Members’ Required Fund Deposits and 
Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirements, manage its credit 
exposures to Members by maintaining 
sufficient resources to cover those credit 
exposures fully with a high degree of 
confidence. The proposed correlation 
calculation change for bond haircut 
models as described above would help 
improve FICC’s ability to determine the 
appropriate bond haircut charges, thus 
ensuring Members’ portfolio risks are 
adequately identified, measured and 
monitored. It would help ensure that the 
margin FICC collects from Members is 
sufficient to mitigate the credit exposure 
presented by the Members. As a result, 
FICC believes that the proposal would 
enhance FICC’s ability to effectively 
identify, measure, and monitor its credit 
exposures and would enhance its ability 
to maintain sufficient financial 
resources to cover its credit exposure to 
each participant fully with a high degree 
of confidence, consistent with the 
requirements of Rule 17ad–22(e)(4)(i) 
under the Act.
24 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(6)(i) under the Act 
requires, among other things, a covered 
clearing agency to establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
cover its credit exposures to its 
participants by establishing a risk-based 
margin system that, at a minimum, 
considers, and produces margin levels 
commensurate with, the risks and 
particular attributes of each relevant 
product, portfolio, and market.
25 FICC 
believes that the proposed change to 
enhance the correlation calculation for 
bond haircut models is consistent with 
the requirements of Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(6)(i) cited above. The Required 
Fund Deposits and Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirements are comprised of

risk-based components (as margin) that 
are calculated and assessed daily to 
limit FICC’s credit exposures to 
Members. FICC is proposing a change 
that is designed to make the bond 
haircut models more effective in 
measuring and addressing credit risk. 
The proposed change to the correlation 
calculation for bond haircut models 
would help to ensure margin levels are 
commensurate with the risk exposure 
that arises from bonds held in Members’ 
portfolios. It would also help ensure the 
margin that FICC collects from Members 
is sufficient to mitigate the credit 
exposure presented by the Members. 
Overall, this proposed change would 
allow FICC to more effectively address 
the risks presented by Members. In this 
way, the proposed change to the 
correlation calculation for bond haircut 
models would enhance the ability of 
FICC to produce margin levels 
commensurate with the risks and 
particular attributes of each relevant 
product, portfolio, and market. As such, 
FICC believes that this proposed change 
is consistent with the requirements of 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(6)(i) under the Act.
26 
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
FICC believes the proposed change to 
enhance the correlation calculation for 
bond haircut models could impose a 
burden on competition. As a result of 
this proposed change, participants may 
experience increases in their Required 
Fund Deposits and/or Segregated 
Customer Margin Requirements. Such 
increases could burden participants that 
have lower operating margins or higher 
costs of capital than other participants. 
It is not clear whether the burden on 
competition would necessarily be 
significant because it would depend on 
whether the affected participants were 
similarly situated in terms of business 
type and size; however, regardless of 
whether the burden on competition is 
significant, FICC believes that any 
burden on competition would be 
necessary and appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
Specifically, as described in this filing 
and further below, FICC believes that 
the above-described burden on 
competition that may be created by this 
proposed change would be necessary in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act 
because the rules of a clearing agency 
must be designed to assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds that 
are in FICC’s custody or control, 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Act.
27 FICC believes that the 
proposed change to the correlation 
calculation for bond haircut models as 
described above would enable FICC to 
further improve margin resilience with 
respect to bonds held in Members’ 
portfolios such that, in the event of a 
Member default, FICC’s operations 
would not be disrupted and non- 
defaulting Members would not be 
exposed to losses they cannot anticipate 
or control. As such, this proposed 
change is designed to assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds 
which are in the custody or control of 
FICC, consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. 
FICC also believes the proposed 
change to the correlation calculation for 
bond haircut models is necessary to 
support FICC’s compliance with Rules 
17ad–22(e)(4)(i) and (e)(6)(i) under the 
Act,
28 which require FICC to establish, 
implement, maintain, and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to (x) effectively 
identify, measure, monitor, and manage 
its credit exposures to participants and 
those arising from its payment, clearing, 
and settlement processes and (y) cover 
its credit exposures to its participants by 
establishing a risk-based margin system 
that, at a minimum, considers, and 
produces margin levels commensurate 
with, the risks and particular attributes 
of each relevant product, portfolio, and 
market. 
As described above, FICC believes 
that the proposed change to the 
correlation calculation for bond haircut 
models would allow FICC to better 
mitigate risk exposure resulting from 
bonds held in Members’ portfolios. 
Accordingly, FICC believes that this 
proposed change would allow FICC to 
effectively identify, measure, monitor, 
and manage its credit exposures to 
participants and better limit FICC’s 
credit exposures to participants and 
cover its credit exposures to its 
participants by producing margin levels 
commensurate with the risks and 
particular attributes of each relevant 
product, portfolio, and market, 
consistent with the requirements of 
Rules 17ad–22(e)(4)(i) and (e)(6)(i) 
under the Act.
29 
FICC also believes that the above- 
described burden on competition that 
could be created by the proposed 
change to the correlation calculation for 
bond haircut models would be 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act because such 
change has been appropriately designed 
to assure the safeguarding of securities 
and funds which are in the custody or 
control of FICC, as described in detail 
above. The proposed change to the 
correlation calculation for bond haircut 
models is specifically designed to cover 
risk exposures from bonds held in 
Members’ portfolios. Any increase in 
Required Fund Deposit and/or 
Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirement as a result of such 
proposed change for a particular 
participant would be in direct relation 
to the specific risks presented by such 
participant’s portfolio, and each 
participant’s Required Fund Deposit 
and/or Segregated Customer Margin 
Requirement would continue to be 
calculated with the same parameters 
and at the same confidence level. 
Therefore, participants with portfolios 
that present similar risks, regardless of 
the type of participant, would have 
similar impacts on their Required Fund 
Deposit and/or Segregated Customer 
Margin Requirement amounts. In 
addition, the proposed change to the 
correlation calculation for bond haircut 
models would improve the risk-based 
margining methodology that FICC 
employs to set margin requirements and 
better limit FICC’s credit exposures to 
its participants. Therefore, because the 
proposed change is designed to provide 
FICC with a more appropriate and 
complete measure of the risks presented 
by participants’ portfolios, FICC 
believes this proposed change is 
appropriately designed to meet its risk 
management goals and its regulatory 
obligations. 
Accordingly, FICC does not believe 
that the proposed change to the 
correlation calculation for bond haircut 
models would impose any burden on 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act.
30 
FICC does not believe the proposed 
technical change to the QRM 
Methodology Document would have any 
impact on competition. This proposed 
change would enhance the QRM 
Methodology Document by providing 
additional accuracy. The proposed 
technical change would not advantage 
or disadvantage any particular Member 
of FICC or unfairly inhibit access to 
FICC’s services. FICC therefore does not 
believe the proposed technical change 
would have any impact, or impose any 
burden, on competition.

Joint Industry Plan; Notice of Filing 
and Immediate Effectiveness of 
Amendment to the National Market 
System Plan for the Selection and 
Reservation of Securities Symbols To 
Add Texas Stock Exchange LLC as a 
Party Thereto 
January 29, 2026. 
Pursuant to Section 11A(a)(3) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)
1 and Rule 608 thereunder,2 
notice is hereby given that on January 
23, 2026, Texas Stock Exchange LLC 
(‘‘TXSE’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) an 
amendment to the National Market 
System Plan for the Selection and 
Reservation of Securities Symbols 
(‘‘Symbology Plan’’ or ‘‘Plan’’).
3 The 
amendment proposes to add TXSE as a 
party to the Symbology Plan. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed 
amendment from interested persons. 
I. Description and Purpose of the 
Amendment 
The current parties to the Symbology 
Plan are 24X National Exchange LLC, 
BOX Exchange, LLC, Nasdaq BX, Inc., 
Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc., Cboe EDGA 
Exchange, Inc., Cboe EDGX Exchange, 
Inc., Cboe Exchange, Inc., NYSE Texas, 
Inc, Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc., Investors Exchange, 
LLC, Long-Term Stock Exchange, Inc., 
MEMX LLC, Miami International 
Securities Exchange, LLC, MIAX 
PEARL, LLC, Nasdaq ISE, LLC, The 
Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, New York 
Stock Exchange LLC, NYSE American 
LLC, NYSE National, Inc., NYSE Arca, 
Inc., and Nasdaq PHLX LLC. The 
proposed amendment to the Symbology 
Plan would add TXSE as a party to the 
Symbology Plan. A self-regulatory 
organization (‘‘SRO’’) may become a 
party to the Symbology Plan if it 
satisfies the requirements of Section I(c) 
of the Plan. Specifically, an SRO may 
become a party to the Symbology Plan 
if: (i) it maintains a market for the listing 
or trading of Plan Securities
4 in 
accordance with rules approved by the 
Commission; (ii) it signs a current copy 
of the Plan; and (iii) becomes a party to 
any contract required pursuant to 
Section III of the Plan with the 
Processor (as such term is defined in the 
Plan).
5 
The Exchange has submitted a signed 
copy of the Symbology Plan to the 
Commission in accordance with the 
requirement set forth in the Symbology 
Plan regarding new parties to the plan. 
Additionally, the Exchange has 
represented that it maintains a market 
for the listing or trading of Plan 
Securities. Finally, the Exchange has 
represented that it has become a party 
to any contract with the Processor. 
II. Effectiveness of the Proposed 
Symbology Plan Amendment 
The foregoing proposed Symbology 
Plan amendment has become effective
