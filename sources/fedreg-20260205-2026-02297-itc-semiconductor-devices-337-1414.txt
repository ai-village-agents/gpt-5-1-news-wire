SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission instituted this investigation 
on August 30, 2024, based on a complaint filed by Infineon Technologies 
Americas Corp. of El Segundo, California, and Infineon Technologies 
Austria AG of Villach, Austria (collectively, ``Complainants'' or 
``Infineon''). 89 FR 70667-68 (Aug. 30, 2024). The complaint, as 
supplemented, alleges violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1337, in the importation into the United 
States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States 
after importation of certain semiconductor devices and products 
containing the same by reason of infringement of claims 1-4, 6, 9, and 
17 of U.S. Patent No. 9,899,481 (``the '481 patent''); claims 1, 2, 8-
10, and 13-15 of U.S. Patent No. 8,686,562 (``the '562 patent''); 
claims 1-4, 8, and 9 of U.S. Patent No. 9,070,755 (``the '755 
patent''); and claims 1, 2, and 10 of U.S. Patent No. 8,264,003 (``the 
'003 patent''). Id. at 70667. The complaint further alleges that a 
domestic industry exists. Id. The Commission's notice of investigation 
named as respondents Innoscience (Suzhou) Technology Company, Ltd., of 
Lili Town, China; Innoscience (Suzhou) Semiconductor Co., Ltd., of Lili 
Town, China; Innoscience (Zhuhai) Technology Company, Ltd., of 
Guangdong, China; and Innoscience America, Inc., of Santa Clara, 
California (collectively, ``Respondents'' or ``Innoscience''). Id. The 
Office of Unfair Import Investigations is not participating in the 
investigation. Id.
    On November 4, 2024, the Commission determined not to review an 
initial determination granting Complainants' unopposed motion to amend 
the complaint and notice of investigation to correct the corporate 
title of Respondent Innoscience (Suzhou) Technology Co., Ltd. to 
Innoscience (Suzhou) Technology Holding Co., Ltd. See Order No. 7 (Oct. 
10, 2024), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice (Nov. 4, 2024). On April 29, 
2025, the Commission determined not to review an initial determination 
granting Complainants' unopposed motion to terminate the investigation 
as to all asserted claims of the '003 patent and claim 9 of the '481 
patent. See Order No. 27 (Apr. 3, 2025), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice 
(Apr. 29, 2025). And on May 20, 2025, the Commission determined not to 
review an initial determination granting Complainants' unopposed motion 
to terminate the investigation as to all asserted claims of the '562 
patent. See Order No. 46 (Apr. 30, 2025), unreviewed by Comm'n Notice 
(May 20, 2025).
    On December 2, 2025, the ALJ issued the Final ID finding a 
violation of section 337 by Innoscience with respect to the '481 
patent, and no violation with respect to the '755 patent. The Final ID 
finds, inter alia, that (1) Infineon proved infringement and 
satisfaction of the technical prong of the domestic industry 
requirement (``technical prong'') for claims 1-4, 6, and 17 of the '481 
patent, and that Innoscience did not show any of those claims invalid; 
(2) Infineon failed to show infringement or satisfaction of the 
technical prong for claims 1-4, 8, and 9 of the '755 patent and 
Innoscience did not show any of the asserted claims of the '755 patent 
invalid. The Final ID also finds that Infineon satisfied the economic 
prong of the domestic industry requirement for the '481 patent.
    The ALJ also issued a recommended determination (``RD'') on remedy 
and bonding. The RD recommends that, if the Commission were to find a 
violation, it should issue a limited exclusion order as well as and 
cease and desist orders against the Respondents based on their 
significant U.S. inventory and significant U.S. operations. The RD 
further recommends that the Commission issue a bond of one hundred 
(100) percent.
    On December 15, 2025, Innoscience filed a petition for review of 
the Final ID's finding of violation as to the '481 patent. That same 
day, Infineon filed a petition for review of the Final ID's finding of 
no violation as to the '755 patent. The parties filed responses to the 
petitions on December 23, 2025.
    Having reviewed the record of the investigation, including the 
Final ID, the parties' submissions to the ALJ, the petitions for 
review, and the responses thereto, the Commission has determined to 
review the Final ID in part. Specifically, the Commission has 
determined to review the Final ID's findings as to the '481 patent 
regarding claim construction of ``lateral transistor devices,'' 
infringement, technical and economic prongs of the domestic industry 
requirement, and validity. The Commission has determined not to review 
the remainder of the Final ID.
    In connection with its review, the Commission requests responses to 
the following questions. The parties are requested to brief their 
positions with reference to the applicable law and the existing 
evidentiary record.
    1. With respect to whether claims 1-3 and 6 of the '481 patent are 
rendered obvious by Nega in combination with Roberts:
    a. Have Respondents met their burden to show a reasonable 
likelihood of success? In answering this question, please address, in 
addition to any other relevant considerations, Infineon's arguments 
regarding the complexities of packaging design (including such factors 
as thermal control and current conductions).
    b. If the Commission finds that Respondents have made a prima facie 
showing of obviousness, do secondary considerations rebut this showing? 
In this situation, should the Commission remand the issue to the ALJ to 
make findings on secondary considerations in the first instance?
    2. Does the record permit a quantitative and qualitative assessment 
of the significance of complainant's domestic industry investments/
expenses that takes into account all non-U.S. activities, including 
manufacturing, related to the DI products? Examples of such a 
quantitative assessment include a comparison of domestic with foreign 
investments; a value-added analysis; or a comparison of domestic 
investments to total value of, or revenue (U.S., global, or both) from, 
the DI products. In answering this question, please address the 
appropriate use of the data in CDX-0005C.25.
    The parties are invited to brief only the discrete issues requested 
above. The parties are not to brief other issues on review, which are 
adequately presented in the parties' existing filings.
    In connection with the final disposition of this investigation, the 
statute authorizes issuance of, inter alia, (1) an exclusion order that 
could result in the exclusion of the subject articles from entry into 
the United States; and/or (2) cease and desist orders that could result 
in the respondents being required to cease and desist from engaging in 
unfair acts in the importation and sale of such articles. Accordingly, 
the Commission is interested in receiving written submissions that 
address the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered. If a party 
seeks exclusion of an

[[Page 5261]]

article from entry into the United States for purposes other than entry 
for consumption, the party should so indicate and provide information 
establishing that activities involving other types of entry either are 
adversely affecting it or likely to do so. For background, see Certain 
Devices for Connecting Computers via Telephone Lines, Inv. No. 337-TA-
360, USITC Pub. No. 2843, Comm'n Op. at 7-10 (Dec. 1994).
    The statute requires the Commission to consider the effects of that 
remedy upon the public interest. The public interest factors the 
Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and 
cease and desist orders would have on: (1) the public health and 
welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. 
production of articles that are like or directly competitive with those 
that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers. The 
Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions 
that address the aforementioned public interest factors in the context 
of this investigation.
    In connection with the consideration of the public interest, the 
Commission requests responses from the parties to the following 
question:
    1. Please identify which, if any, of the '481 patent accused 
products are subject to the remedial orders in Investigation No. 337-
TA-1366.
    2. Please identify with supporting facts and data the share of the 
U.S. market for the '481 patent accused products, and also delineate 
the market share for any '481 patent accused products that are not 
subject to the remedial orders in Investigation No. 337-TA-1366. Please 
also identify with supporting facts and data the share of the U.S. 
market for the Infineon '481 patent DI products, as well as other 
suppliers and whether these suppliers have the capability to supply 
U.S. demand in the event of an exclusion order and/or cease and desist 
orders.
    3. Please explain with supporting facts and data the extent to 
which competitors' products are reasonable substitutes for the accused 
products.
    If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the U.S. Trade 
Representative, as delegated by the President, has 60 days to approve, 
disapprove, or take no action on the Commission's determination. See 
Presidential Memorandum of July 21, 2005, 70 FR 43251 (July 26, 2005). 
During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the 
United States under bond, in an amount determined by the Commission and 
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is 
therefore interested in receiving submissions concerning the amount of 
the bond that should be imposed if a remedy is ordered.
    Written Submissions: The parties to the investigation are requested 
to file written submissions on the issues identified in this notice. 
Parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, and any 
other interested parties are encouraged to file written submissions on 
the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. Such 
submissions should address the recommended determination by the ALJ on 
remedy and bonding.
    In its initial submission, Complainant is also requested to 
identify the remedy sought and to submit proposed remedial orders for 
the Commission's consideration. Complainant is further requested to 
state the date that the '481 patent expires, to provide the HTSUS 
subheadings under which the accused products are imported, and to 
supply the identification information for all known importers of the 
products at issue in this investigation. All initial written 
submissions, from the parties and/or third parties/interested 
government agencies, and proposed remedial orders from the parties must 
be filed no later than close of business on February 17, 2026. All 
reply submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on 
February 24, 2026. Opening submissions from the parties are limited to 
30 pages. Reply submissions from the parties are limited to 15 pages. 
All submission from third parties and/or interested government agencies 
are limited to 10 pages. No further submissions on any of these issues 
will be permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.
    Persons filing written submissions must file the original document 
electronically on or before the deadlines stated above pursuant to 19 
CFR 210.4(f). Submissions should refer to the investigation number 
(Inv. No. 337-TA-1414) in a prominent place on the cover page and/or

with a header indicating that the document contains confidential 
information. This marking will be deemed to satisfy the request 
procedure set forth in Rules 201.6(b) and 210.5(e)(2) (19 CFR 201.6(b) 
& 210.5(e)(2)). Documents for which confidential treatment by the 
Commission is properly sought will be treated accordingly. Any non-
party wishing to submit comments containing confidential information 
must serve those comments on the parties to the investigation pursuant 
to the applicable Administrative Protective Order. A redacted non-
confidential version of the document must also be filed with the 
Commission and served on any parties to the investigation within two 
business days of any confidential filing. All information, including 
confidential business information and documents for which confidential 
treatment is properly sought, submitted to the Commission for purposes 
of this investigation may be disclosed to and used: (i) by the 
Commission, its employees and Offices, and contract personnel (a) for 
developing or maintaining the records of this or a related proceeding, 
or (b) in internal investigations, audits, reviews, and evaluations 
relating to the programs, personnel, and operations of the Commission 
including under 5 U.S.C. Appendix 3; or (ii) by U.S. government 
employees and contract personnel, solely for cybersecurity purposes. 
All contract personnel will sign appropriate nondisclosure agreements. 
All nonconfidential written submissions will be available for public 
inspection on EDIS.
    The Commission vote for this determination took place on February 
2, 2026.
