RE: Staff Interpretation Regarding Preservation of Legacy Swap Status in an Anticipated 

Legal Entity Merger  

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

The Market Participants Division (“MPD”) and the Division of Clearing and Risk (“DCR” and, 
together with MPD, the “Divisions”) of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” 
or “Commission”) are issuing this letter in response to a request (the “Request”) from Morgan 
Stanley, the parent of certain registered swap dealers more fully described below (each an “SD”), 
that  the  Divisions  issue  an  interpretative  letter  pursuant  to  17  CFR  140.99  providing  guidance 
regarding the treatment of certain Legacy Swaps (as defined below).  Specifically, Morgan Stanley 
requests guidance confirming for the benefit of all market participants, that, under the facts and 
circumstances summarized below, the transfer of a Legacy Swap as a result of its internal corporate 
merger involving its subsidiaries does not affect the swap’s status as a Legacy Swap, and therefore, 
its obligations for margin under Section 4s(e)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”)1 
and Commission regulations 23.150 through 23.161 (together, the “CFTC Margin Rule”)2 and 
clearing under Section 2(h)(1) of the CEA3 and Commission regulations 50.2 and 50.4 (together, 
the “Swap Clearing Requirement”).4

I. 

CFTC Regulatory Background 

(1) CFTC Margin Rule 

Section 4s(e) of the CEA directs the Commission to adopt rules establishing minimum initial and 
variation margin requirements on all swaps5 that are (i) entered into by an SD for which there is 
no  prudential  regulator  (such  SDs  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “Non-Bank  Covered  Swap 
Entities”  or  “Non-Bank  CSEs”)  and  (ii)  not  cleared  by  a  derivatives  clearing  organization 
(“DCO”)  (“uncleared  swaps”).6    The  Commission  implemented  this  statutory  authority  by 
promulgating rules in 2016, which establish requirements for a Non-Bank CSE to collect and post 
initial margin and variation margin for uncleared swaps.7  These requirements vary based on the 
type of counterparty to such swaps and the location of the Non-Bank CSE and its counterparty.8  
Generally,  these  requirements  also  apply  only  to  uncleared  swaps  entered  into  on  or  after  the 
compliance date applicable to a particular Non-Bank CSE and its counterparty (each a “covered 
swap”).9  An uncleared swap entered into prior to a Non-Bank CSE’s applicable compliance date 
for  a  particular  counterparty  (each  a  “Margin  Legacy  Swap”)  is  generally  not  subject  to  the 
margin requirements in the CFTC Margin Rule.10 

To the extent that more than one uncleared swap is executed between a Non-Bank CSE and its 
counterparty, the CFTC Margin Rule permits the netting of required margin amounts of each swap 
under certain circumstances.11  In particular, the CFTC Margin Rule, subject to certain limitations, 
permits  a  Non-Bank  CSE  to  calculate  initial  margin  and  variation  margin,  respectively,  on  an 

5 For the definition of swap, see Section 1a(47) of the CEA and Commission regulation 1.3. 7 U.S.C. 1a(47) and 17 
CFR 1.3.  The “swap” definition includes, among other things, an interest rate swap, commodity swap, credit default 
swap, and currency swap. 

6 7 U.S.C. 6s(e)(2)(B)(ii).  In Commission regulation 23.151, the Commission defined uncleared swaps to mean those 
swaps that are not cleared by a registered DCO or a DCO that the Commission has exempted from registration as 
provided under the CEA.  17 CFR 23.151. 

7 See Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants, 81 FR 636 (Jan. 6, 
2016) (“CFTC Margin Release”); see also Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major 
Swap Participants – Cross-Border Application of the Margin Requirements, 81 FR 34818 (May 31, 2016).    

8 See 17 CFR 23.152 and 23.153.  For example, the CFTC Margin Rule does not require a Non-Bank CSE to collect 
margin from, or post margin to, a counterparty that is neither a swap entity nor a financial end user (each as defined 
in 17 CFR 23.151).  Pursuant to Section 2(e) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(e), each counterparty to an uncleared swap must 
be an eligible contract participant, as defined in Section 1a(18) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 1a(18).  See also 17 CFR 23.160 
(for the cross-border application of the CFTC Margin Rule).  

9 Pursuant to Commission regulation 23.161, compliance dates for the CFTC Margin Rule are staggered such that 
Non-Bank CSEs must come into compliance in a series of phases.  The first phase affected Non-Bank CSEs and their 
counterparties, each with the largest aggregate outstanding notional amounts of uncleared swaps and certain other 
financial products.  These Non-Bank CSEs began complying with both the initial and variation margin requirements 
of the CFTC Margin Rule on September 1, 2016.  The second phase began March 1, 2017, and required Non-Bank 
CSEs  to  comply  with  the  variation  margin  requirements  of  Commission  regulation  23.153  with  all  relevant 
counterparties not covered in the first phase.  See 17 CFR 23.161.  Initial margin requirements with counterparties 
with successively lesser outstanding notional amounts were phased in until September 1, 2022. 

10 See CFTC Margin Release, 81 FR at 651; and 17 CFR 23.161. 

11 See CFTC Margin Release, 81 FR at 651; and 17 CFR 23.152(c) and 23.153(d).

aggregate net basis across uncleared swaps that are executed under the same eligible master netting 
agreement (“EMNA”).  Moreover, the CFTC Margin Rule permits swap counterparties to identify 
one  or  more  separate  netting  portfolios  (i.e.,  a  specified  group  of  uncleared  swaps  the  margin 
obligations  of  which  will  be  netted only  against  each  other)  under  the  same  EMNA,  including 
having  separate  netting  portfolios  for  covered  swaps  and  Margin  Legacy  Swaps.12   A  netting 
portfolio that contains only Margin Legacy Swaps is not subject to the initial and variation margin 
requirements set out in the CFTC Margin Rule.13  However, if a netting portfolio contains any 
covered swaps, the entire netting portfolio (including all Margin Legacy Swaps) is subject to such 
requirements.14 

A Margin Legacy Swap may lose its legacy treatment under the CFTC Margin Rule, causing it to 
be  subject  to  the  requirements  of  the  CFTC  Margin  Rule.   For  reasons  discussed  in  the  CFTC 
Margin Release, the Commission elected not to extend the meaning of Margin Legacy Swaps to 
include  (1)  Margin  Legacy  Swaps  that  are  amended  in  a  material  or  nonmaterial  manner;  (2) 
novations of Margin Legacy Swaps; and (3) new swaps that result from portfolio compression of 
Margin Legacy Swaps.15 

(2) Swap Clearing Requirement 

Section 2(h)(1)(A) of the CEA states that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to engage in a swap 
unless that person submits such swap for clearing to a [DCO] that is registered under [the CEA] 
or  a  [DCO]  that  is  exempt  from  registration  under  [the  CEA]  if  the  swap  is  required  to  be 
cleared.”16  In 2012, the Commission issued a Swap Clearing Requirement Determination, which 
requires certain market participants to clear two classes of credit default swaps and four classes of 
interest  rate  swaps.17    In  2016,  the  Commission  issued  a  second  Swap  Clearing  Requirement 
Determination, which expanded the Swap Clearing Requirement to include additional interest rate 
swaps.18

Like  the  CFTC  Margin  Rule,  the  Commission’s  Swap  Clearing  Requirement  Determinations 
established  a  series  of  compliance  dates  to  phase-in  compliance  with  the  Swap  Clearing 
Requirement.19  Commission regulation 50.5 provides that swaps entered into before July 21, 2010, 
or, if later, the application of the Swap Clearing Requirement for a particular class of swaps are 
not subject to the Swap Clearing Requirement so long as such swaps are reported to a swap data 
repository  (“Clearing  Legacy  Swaps”  and  together  with  Margin  Legacy  Swaps,  “Legacy 
Swaps”).20   

In its 2012 rulemaking, the Commission clarified that the Swap Clearing Requirement applies to 
all new swaps, as well as changes in the ownership of a swap, including assignment, novation, 
exchange, transfer, or conveyance.21   

II. 

Summary of the Request  

Based  on  the  representations  made  in  the  Request,  we  understand  the  relevant  facts  to  be  as 
follows. As part of an internal corporate reorganization, Morgan Stanley informed the Divisions 
of an anticipated merger (“Merger”) involving its subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Capital Services 
LLC (“MSCS”)22 and Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (“MSBNA”), both of which are Commission-
registered SDs.  

Morgan  Stanley  represented  that  the  Merger  will  result  in  the  merger  of  the  fixed  income 
derivatives and foreign exchange swaps business of MSCS (via a split from MSCS by operation 
of  state  corporation  law)  with,  and  into,  MSBNA,  with  MSBNA  being  the  surviving 
entity.  Accordingly, the Merger will result in certain swaps in the name of MSCS (the “Merger 
Portfolio”)  being  assumed  by  MSBNA  and  becoming  part  of  the  swap  portfolio  of  MSBNA.  
Morgan Stanley represented that the Merger will not impact or change the economic terms and 
valuation  of  the  swaps  in  the  Merger  Portfolio;  only  the  name  of  the  SD  will  be  changed  to 
MSBNA as the successor to the Merger Portfolio.23  MPD has previously provided a no-action 
position stating that MPD would not recommend an enforcement action for failure to comply with 
the CFTC Margin Rule with respect to a Legacy Swap if such swap is amended in a way that does 
not affect “the economic obligations of the parties or the valuation of the Legacy Swap.”24 

The  Merger  Portfolio  contains  Legacy  Swaps  (the  “Legacy  Portfolio”).    Morgan  Stanley 
represents  that  the  Legacy  Portfolio  comprises  approximately  1%  of  the  Merger  Portfolio,  as 
measured  on  a  notional  basis,  and  contains  primarily  interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  swaps 
entered  into  before  the  relevant  compliance  dates  under  the  applicable  uncleared  swap  margin 
rules.25  Of the Legacy Portfolio, less than 15% by notional are Clearing Legacy Swaps and roughly

20 17 CFR 50.5. 

21 See 2012 Swap Clearing Requirement, 77 FR at 74316. 

22 MSCS is Morgan Stanley’s primary non-bank U.S. SD.  

23 Ancillary technical changes, such as basic corporate status representations, change of notice addresses, settlement 
instructions and other administrative or operational details may also be updated. 

24 Letter 19-13 at 8.   

25 Morgan Stanley noted that approximately 3% of the Merger Portfolio, measured on a notional basis, is composed 
of credit default swaps (inclusive of related products like credit swaptions) and commodities swaps.  Furthermore, as 

4 

 
 
CFTC LETTER NO. 26-03   INTERPRETATIVE   JANUARY 30, 2026 

three quarters of its notional are with other dealers, some of which are Non-Bank CSEs that would 
otherwise be subject to the CFTC Margin Rule. 

According to Morgan Stanley, the proposed Merger will merge the Legacy Portfolio of MSCS 
with and into the swap portfolio of MSBNA, where (i) the merger will occur by operation of law, 
as opposed to via novation, assignment or sale of assets, and will not alter the economic terms of 
any swap in the Legacy Portfolio; (ii) the specific commercial intent for the Merger is to merge 
the fixed income derivatives and foreign exchange swaps business of MSCS into MSBNA and is 
not to evade margin or swap clearing requirements; and (iii) the Merger is a unique corporate event 
with legitimate business objectives that do not implicate the evasion concerns expressed by the 
Commission regarding novations of, or amendments to, Legacy Swaps. 

Although Commission staff has provided guidance and taken staff action  recognizing a range of 
circumstances  where  a  swap’s  status  as  a  Legacy  Swap  could  be  maintained  even  after  the 
occurrence  of  what  might  otherwise  constitute  a  material  event  (e.g.,  in  connection  with  the 
UBS/CS  business  transfer,  LIBOR  transition,  and  Brexit),  Morgan  Stanley  requests  that 
Commission staff, for the benefit and clarity of all market participants, confirm that a swap’s status 
as a Legacy Swap is not affected by a merger as described above.26 

III. 

Staff Interpretation Regarding Retention of Legacy Status Upon Merger 

As  described  above,  Morgan  Stanley  is  planning  an  internal  reorganization  pursuant  to  which 
MSCS’s fixed income derivatives and foreign exchange swaps business will be merged with and 
into MSBNA.  Specifically, MSCS’s Legacy Portfolio will be merged into the swap portfolio of 
MSBNA by means of an internal reorganization under operation of applicable state corporation 
laws.   

As discussed in the CFTC Margin Rule, uncleared swaps entered into prior to a Non-Bank CSE’s 
applicable compliance date for a particular counterparty are not subject to the margin requirements 
in Commission regulation 23.161.27  As represented by Morgan Stanley, the Merger relates to a 
reorganization with legitimate business objectives.  The Divisions note that, with respect to the 
Legacy  Swaps,  there  is  no  change  in  ownership,  including  assignment,  novation,  exchange, 
transfer or conveyance.28  Furthermore, the underlying facts with respect to this Merger indicate 
that the economic terms and valuation of the swaps in the Legacy Portfolio will not change as a 
result of this restructuring and will not be accompanied by any changes to the contractual terms of 
such swaps (other than a name change).29  Thus, no amendments will be made to the swaps at issue 
that would affect the economic obligations or valuations of the swaps.  The ownership and original 
counterparties that MSCS faces on such Legacy Swaps also remain the same, and the only change 
is that MSBNA is the successor to such Legacy Swaps as a result of the Merger by operation of 

measured on a notional basis, less than 5% of these swaps constitute Margin Legacy Swaps.  With respect to the 
Clearing Legacy Swaps, Morgan Stanley noted that all such swaps are interest rate swaps.

27 See CFTC Margin Release, 81 FR at 651, and Commission regulation 23.161.  17 CFR 23.161.

law, thus mooting Commission’s concern of any “incentives to ‘trade’ historical swaps through the 
assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, or conveyance processes to avoid required clearing.”30 
MPD is therefore of the view that the Legacy Swaps at issue retain their status as legacy swaps for 
any Non-Bank CSE counterparties and thus, remain exempt from the CFTC Margin Rule.  DCR 
is also of the view that the Merger will not cause the Legacy Swaps at issue to lose their legacy 
status with respect to the Swap Clearing Requirement.
