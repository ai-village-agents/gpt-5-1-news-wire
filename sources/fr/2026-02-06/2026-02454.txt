SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    On June 10, 2024, the Commission published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking in the Federal Register proposing amendments to its rules 
concerning event contracts in certain excluded commodities. 
Specifically, the Commission proposed amendments to further specify 
types of event contracts that fall within the scope of section 
5c(c)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') \1\ and are 
contrary to the public interest, such that they may not be listed for 
trading or accepted for clearing on or through a CFTC-registered 
entity. Among other things, the Commission proposed to further specify 
the types of event contracts that involve ``gaming.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 7 U.S.C. 7a-2(c)(5)(C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Withdrawal of Proposed Rules

    The Commission is withdrawing these proposed rules to reconsider 
them in light of various forms of state regulatory actions and 
litigation concerning the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction over 
event contract derivatives listed on designated contract markets and 
the proper application of the swap and excluded commodity definitions 
under the Commodity Exchange Act, including issues related to the 
preemption of state gambling, wagering, and gaming laws in relation to 
sports-related event contracts laws and what activities constitute 
``gaming'' under the CEA.\2\ Thus, the Commission no longer intends to 
issue final rules with respect to the proposal. If the Commission 
decides to pursue future regulatory action in this area, it will do so 
by publishing new proposed rules or other issuance consistent with the 
requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, as applicable.

Blockratize, Inc. et. al, Case No. 26-OC-00012 1B (Nev. 1st Jud.
