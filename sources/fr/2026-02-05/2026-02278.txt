Takes of Marine Mammals Incidental to Specified Activities; 
Taking Marine Mammals Incidental to Pacific Gas & Electric Sediment 
Remediation Project, Remedial Response Area C, San Francisco Bay

AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

ACTION: Notice; issuance of incidental harassment authorization.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: In accordance with regulations implementing the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act (MMPA) as amended, notification is hereby given that 
NMFS has issued an incidental harassment authorization (IHA) to Pacific 
Gas & Electric (PG&E) for authorization to take marine mammals 
incidental to construction for a sediment remediation project in San 
Francisco Bay, California (CA).

DATES: This authorization is effective for 1 year from the date of 
notification by the IHA-holder, not to exceed 1 year from the date of 
issuance (February 2, 2026).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

MMPA Background and Determinations

    The MMPA prohibits the ``take'' of marine mammals, with certain 
exceptions. Among the exceptions is section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA 
(16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) which directs the Secretary of Commerce (as 
delegated to NMFS) to allow, upon request, the incidental, but not 
intentional, taking by harassment of small numbers of marine mammals by 
U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial 
fishing) within a specified geographical region if certain findings are 
made and the public has an opportunity to comment on the proposed IHA.
    Specifically, NMFS will issue an IHA if it finds that the taking 
will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) and will not 
have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species 
or stock(s) for taking for subsistence uses (where relevant). Further, 
NMFS must prescribe the permissible methods of taking and other ``means 
of effecting the least [practicable] adverse impact'' on the affected 
species or stocks and their habitat, paying particular attention to 
rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and on 
the availability of such species or stocks for taking for certain 
subsistence uses (referred to here as ``mitigation''). NMFS must also 
prescribe requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of 
such takings. The definitions of key terms, such as ``take,'' 
``harassment,'' and ``negligible impact,'' can be found in the MMPA and 
the NMFS' implementing regulations (see 16 U.S.C. 1362; 50 CFR 
216.103).
    On December 29, 2025, a notice of NMFS' proposal to issue an IHA to 
PG&E for take of marine mammals incidental to construction for a 
sediment remediation project in San Francisco Bay, CA was published in 
the Federal Register (90 FR 60635). In that notice, NMFS indicated the 
estimated numbers, type, and methods of incidental take proposed for 
each species or stock, as well as the mitigation, monitoring, and 
reporting measures that would be required should the IHA be issued. The 
Federal Register notice also included analysis to support NMFS' 
preliminary conclusions and determinations that the IHA, if issued, 
would satisfy the requirements of section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA for 
issuance of the IHA. The Federal Register notice included web links to 
a draft IHA for review, as well as other supporting documents.
    No comments were received during the public comment period. There 
are no changes to the specified activity, the species taken, the 
proposed numbers, type, or methods of take, or the mitigation, 
monitoring, or reporting measures in the proposed IHA notice. No new 
information that would change any of the preliminary analyses, 
conclusions, or determinations in the proposed IHA notice has become 
available since that notice was published, and therefore, the 
preliminary analyses, conclusions, and determinations included in the 
proposed IHA are considered final.

National Environmental Policy Act

    To comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA; 
42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 216-6A, 
NMFS must review our proposed action (i.e., the issuance of an IHA) 
with respect to potential impacts on the human environment. This action 
is consistent with categories of activities identified in Categorical 
Exclusion B4 (IHAs with no anticipated serious injury or mortality) of 
the Companion Manual for NAO 216-6A, which do not individually or 
cumulatively have the potential for significant impacts on the quality 
of the human environment and for which we have not identified any 
extraordinary circumstances that would preclude this categorical 
exclusion. Accordingly, NMFS has determined that the issuance of the 
IHA qualifies to be categorically excluded from further NEPA review.

Endangered Species Act

    Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA; 16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) requires that each Federal agency ensures that any 
action it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not likely to jeopardize 
the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or 
result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated 
critical habitat. To ensure ESA compliance for the issuance of IHAs, 
NMFS consults internally whenever we propose to authorize take for 
endangered or threatened species. No incidental take of ESA-listed 
species is authorized or expected to result from this activity. 
Therefore, NMFS has determined that formal consultation under section 7 
of the ESA is not required for this action.

Authorization

    Accordingly, consistent with the requirements of section 
101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, NMFS has issued an IHA to PG&E for 
authorization to take marine mammals incidental to construction for a 
sediment remediation project in San Francisco Bay, CA.

Service.
