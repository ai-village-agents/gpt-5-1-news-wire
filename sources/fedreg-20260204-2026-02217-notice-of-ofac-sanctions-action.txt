C. The respondent’s input to U.S. 
DOT transportation digital infrastructure research and planning needs relating to any or all of the questions below. 
Specific Information Required 
This RFI seeks feedback from the 
public, industry, technology developers, 
State, local and tribal transportation agencies, researchers, and other stakeholders on the research, development and deployment activities necessary to develop a comprehensive, national Transportation Digital Infrastructure (TDI) strategy. This includes identifying opportunities for improved data exchange and interoperability, cyber-resilience, asset management, and technology integration across varied U.S. geographies and operational environments. The insights gained through this RFI will inform a research agenda that supports the development, deployment, and scaling of digital infrastructure nationwide. The following presents key questions in four critical topic areas. 
A. Research, Development and 
Deployment 
1. How should Transportation Digital 
Infrastructure be defined? 
2. What TDI research needs should be 
prioritized? 
3. What travel corridors or regions 
should be prioritized for TDI development and deployment? 
4. Are there existing testbeds, pilots or 
demonstrations that could be leveraged? 
5. What TDI use cases or applications 
should be prioritized? 
6. How should U.S. DOT leverage or 
expand existing programs to advance TDI development and deployment? 
B. System Architecture, Interoperability 
and Standards 
1. What are the key elements of a TDI 
system architecture that can accommodate the operation of all transportation modes including surface, maritime, and aviation? 
2. How can TDI be integrated into 
infrastructure planning, construction and asset management processes? 
3. What methods should be used for 
federating data sharing across States and regions? 
4. What existing architecture 
frameworks or standards could be used to underpin TDI development and deployment (e.g., U.S. DOT’s 
Architecture Reference for Cooperative and Intelligent Transportation (ARC– IT))? 5. What are the necessary latency and 
throughput requirements for safety- critical applications (e.g., Vehicle-to- 
Everything (V2X) communications, Automated Driving Systems (ADS), and Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA))? 
6. What are the highest-priority 
research gaps and challenges to advancing interoperability across modes and sectors? 
C. Artificial Intelligence and 
Automation 
1. How should AI applications be 
leveraged to support TDI development and deployment? 
2. How should TDI be best used to 
accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles, drones and other transformative technologies? 
3. What are the highest-value, near- 
time AI and automation applications enabled by comprehensive sensing and data sharing? 
4. How can AI applications be safely 
deployed to accommodate data exchange and data use across jurisdictional boundaries? 
D. Data Governance, Privacy, and 
Cybersecurity 
1. What data governance principles, 
access controls, and cybersecurity measures are needed to ensure trust, accountability, and privacy? 
2. What models or frameworks should 
be used to ensure secure data exchange (e.g., data trusts, federated data sharing, 
and public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs))? 
3. What are the most significant threat 
vectors introduced by extensive transportation system sensing and data integration, beyond traditional Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) threats? 
4. How should U.S. DOT apply the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to TDI development and deployment? 
5. How should TDI be aligned with 
federal data strategies and privacy frameworks? 
6. How can legacy and proprietary 
data sources be effectively incorporated into a new national data exchange environment?
