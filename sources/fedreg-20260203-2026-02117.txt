COMMISSION 
[Release No. 34–104740; File No. SR–DTC– 
2025–019] 
Self-Regulatory Organizations; The 
Depository Trust Company; Order 
Approving Proposed Rule Change To 
Modify the DTC Settlement Service 
Guide and DTC Rules as They Relate 
to the DTC Net Debit Cap 
January 29, 2026. 
I. Introduction 
On December 18, 2025, the Depository 
Trust Company (‘‘DTC’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) proposed rule change 
SR–DTC–2025–019, pursuant to Section 
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’)
1 and Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.2 The Proposed Rule Change 
would modify the DTC Settlement 
Service Guide (‘‘Settlement Guide’’) and 
the Rules, By-Laws and Organization 
Certificate of DTC (‘‘Rules’’)
3 regarding 
how DTC sets its maximum debit caps 
for Participants, Unaffiliated 
Participants, and Affiliated Families, as 
well as other corresponding changes. 
The Proposed Rule Change was 
published for comment in the Federal 
Register on December 30, 2025.
4 The 
Commission has received no comments 
on the changes proposed. 
For the reasons discussed below, the 
Commission is approving the Proposed 
Rule Change. 
II. Background 
DTC serves as a central securities 
depository
5 and operates a securities 
settlement system. DTC’s activities 
include holding securities in physical or 
dematerialized form, maintaining 
securities accounts for Participants, 
providing central safekeeping and asset 
services, transfers and pledges of 
securities, and the settlement of 
transactions by book entry (free of 
payment or DVP).
6 DTC’s liquidity risk 
management strategy is designed to 
facilitate its maintenance of sufficient 
liquid resources to complete settlement 
each Business Day.
7 To that end, DTC 
uses certain risk management controls, 
including its Collateral Monitor and Net 
Debit Cap, to protect its settlement 
system in the event of a Participant 
default, by ensuring that at any time the 
settlement obligation of any Participant 
will be fully collateralized and that the 
amount to be settled cannot exceed 
DTC’s liquidity resources.
8 
Collateral Monitor. The Collateral 
Monitor is a calculation by which DTC 
measures the sufficiency of the 
Collateral in a Participant’s account to 
cover its net settlement obligation.
9 The 
Collateral Monitor prevents the 
completion of transactions that would 
cause a Participant’s Net Debit Balance 
to exceed the value of Collateral in its 
account.
10 The settlement obligation of 
each Participant must be fully 
collateralized, based on the Collateral 
Monitor. This is designed so that if a 
Participant fails to pay for its settlement 
obligation, DTC will have sufficient

Each Participant’s settlement account may have a 
net credit or net debit position throughout the day 
as transactions are processed. At day’s end, 
Participants will either owe a net debit, be owed a 
net credit, or be balanced. See Disclosure 
Framework, supra note 5, at 63. Based on a 
Participant’s net debit history, these caps adjust 
automatically relative to their highest intraday net 
debit peaks. See Settlement Guide, supra note 3, at

liquid resource’’ means the following, in each

bank of issue or at creditworthy commercial banks; 
(ii) Assets that are readily available and convertible 
into cash through prearranged funding 
arrangements, such as (A) Committed arrangements 
without material adverse change provisions 
including (1) lines of credit, (2) foreign exchange 
swaps, and (3) repurchase agreements, or (B) Other 
prearranged funding arrangements determined to be 
highly reliable even in extreme but plausible market 
conditions by the board of directors of the covered 
clearing agency following a review conducted for 
this purpose not less than annually; and, (iii) Other 
assets that are readily available and eligible for 
pledging to (or conducting other appropriate forms 
of transactions with) a relevant central bank, if the 
covered clearing agency has access to routine credit 
at such central bank in a jurisdiction that permits 
said pledges or other transactions by the covered 
clearing agency. 17 CFR 240.17Ad–22(a)(14).

24 The Participants Fund is comprised of 
Participant deposits into the Core Fund and 
Liquidity Fund. The Core Fund consists of $450 
million, split into the Base Fund ($7,500 deposit 
per Participant) and the Incremental Fund (based 
on the six highest intraday net debit peaks over a 
rolling 60 business day period). The Liquidity Fund 
allocates an additional $700 million among 
Participants with Affiliated Net Debit Caps 
exceeding $2.15 billion. See Settlement Guide, 
supra note 3, at 46–47. 
25 DTC annually renews a 364-day revolving line 
of credit with a group of commercial lenders. 
Borrowed amounts must be backed by adequate 
collateral, and lenders must meet their 
commitments by specific times on the borrowing 
day, given sufficient collateral and adherence to 
time frames. See Disclosure Framework, supra note 
6, at 62. 
26 See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, at 61206. 
27 $1.7 billion of the total LOC is available for 
liquidity purposes. DTC sets the Net Debit Cap 
below the total amount of liquidity resources in 
case the defaulting Participant is a lender to the 
LOC, this is known as the LOC Assumption Buffer. 
DTC has previously explained that the $200 million 
buffer is an amount greater than the contribution of 
any lender to the DTC LOC. See Securities 
Exchange Act Release No. 99456 (Feb. 1, 2024), 89 
FR 8466 at 8468, n. 28 (Feb. 7, 2024). See also

Collateral to obtain funding for 
settlement.11 
At the opening of each business day, 
a Participant’s Collateral Monitor is set 
to zero and built up over the day to 
secure any settlement obligation that 
may arise. A Participant’s actual 
Participant’s Fund Deposit is credited to 
the Collateral Monitor, and updated 
with credits or debits through the day.
12 
At all times the Collateral Monitor 
reflects the amount by which the 
collateral in your account exceeds the 
net debit in your settlement account.
13 
Each transaction involves a collateral 
flow and a cash flow component, one as 
credit and the other as debit.
14 The net 
value of the collateral and cash 
components updates the Collateral 
Monitor. Completing a transaction 
Delivery versus Payment generally 
increases the Collateral Monitor of the 
Deliverer of the security, and decreases 
that of the Receiver of said security, 
based on the difference between the 
collateral and settlement value.
15 DTC 
verifies that a transaction places neither 
party’s Collateral Monitor in the 
negative during processing, and if a 
transaction were to result in a negative 
Collateral Monitor, meaning it is 
undercollateralized, DTC would then 
recycle that transaction until there is 
enough collateral to complete.
16 
Net Debit Cap. The Net Debit Cap is 
an amount calculated daily, which acts 
to ensure that a Participant’s net debit 
balance stays within DTC’s liquidity 
resources, and that DTC can complete 
settlement even if a Participant 
defaults.
17 Specifically, the Net Debit 
Cap limits the settlement net debit a 
Participant could incur during a 
processing day irrespective of available 
collateral, and it is currently capped to 
a maximum amount of $2.15 billion per 
Participant, or $2.85 billion per 
Affiliated Family.
18 
Any transaction that would cause a 
Participant or an Affiliated Family to 
exceed its Net Debit Cap will not be 
processed but will instead remain 
pending until the Net Debit Balance is 
reduced sufficient to permit 
processing.
19 A Net Debit Balance is 
reduced by another transaction which 
creates credits in your account.
20 Most 
credits are generated when a Participant 
either delivers securities versus 
payment, pledges securities for value, 
receives principal, dividend or interest 
allocations, or wires Settlement Progress 
Payments (‘‘SPP’s’’) to DTC’s account at 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York.
21 
DTC Liquidity Resources. Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(7)(ii) under the Act requires DTC, 
as a covered clearing agency, to hold 
qualifying liquid resources sufficient to 
meet the minimum liquidity resource 
requirements in each relevant currency 
for which the covered clearing agency 
has payment obligations owed to 
clearing members.
22 DTC states that it 
currently maintains two resources that 
are considered as a ‘‘qualifying liquid 
resource’’ under Rule 17ad–22(a)
23 
under the Act: (i) required Participants 
Fund Deposits (‘‘Participants Fund’’)
24, 
which applies across all Participants 
and equals $1.15 BN, and (ii) a 
committed line of credit (‘‘LOC’’)
25 of 
$1.9 BN.26 Taken together, the 
Participants Fund and LOC provide 
DTC with $3.05 BN in total qualifying 
liquid resources.
27 
The Commission recently determined 
not to object to an Advance Notice filed 
by DTC proposing to raise prefunded 
liquidity resources through the periodic 
issuance and private placement of 
senior notes (‘‘Debt Issuance’’).
28 DTC 
proposed to issue up to an aggregate 
amount of $3 billion in senior notes, 
DTC has represented that these 
resources are solely to be used to help 
complete settlement in the event of a 
default, therefore the proceeds of the 
Debt Issuance are to supplement and 
diversify the existing qualifying liquid 
resources.
29 
III. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
First, DTC proposes updating its 
Settlement Guide and its Rules to 
amend the Net Debit Cap from the 
current fixed amounts of $2.15 billion 
per Individual Participant and $2.85 
billion per Affiliated Family, 
respectively, to a flexible amount not to 
exceed the available qualifying liquid 
resources at DTC.
30 As stated above in 
Section II, DTC’s Qualifying Liquid 
Resources are comprised of a $1.15 
billion Participants Fund, a $1.9 billion 
LOC, and, going forward, proceeds from 
any issuance of senior notes under the 
Debt Issuance program in an aggregate 
amount not to exceed $3 billion. DTC 
states that Participants have sought a 
reassessment of the Net Debit Cap for 
both Individual Participants and 
Affiliated Families.
31 DTC states that a 
greater maximum Net Debit Cap would 
provide for transaction processing 
efficiencies that would lower the 
likelihood of transactions pending 
under a cap limit or of a Participant 
needing to make SPPs to reduce its

intraday Net Debit Balance.32 DTC 
further states that any additional 
liquidity provided by the Debt Issuance 
allows DTC the flexibility to increase 
the Net Debit Cap in line with the newly 
expanded pool of Qualifying Liquid 
Resources.
33 
To maintain alignment with 
Qualifying Liquid Resources, the 
Proposed Rule Change will edit the Net 
Debit Cap section of the Settlement 
Guide to reflect a new method for 
determining the Net Debit Cap. The 
Proposed Rule Change would eliminate 
the static Net Debit Caps, changing to a 
Net Debit Cap ‘‘based on DTC’s liquidity 
resources, related costs, and projected 
benefits to Participants,’’ and always set 
lower than DTC’s total available 
liquidity.
34 DTC also proposes to clarify 
in the Settlement Guide, with respect to 
Affiliated Families, that the Aggregated 
Affiliated Family Net Debit Cap will be 
shared among the Participants of the 
Affiliated Family according to either (1) 
the proportional liquidity usage of the 
Participants, or (2) as instructed by the 
Affiliated Family in writing.
35 DTC will 
also update the Calculation of 
Participant Net Debit Caps section of the 
Settlement Guide to remove reference to 
the current fixed $2.15 billion Net Debit 
Cap, and to state that notice of any 
reduction of the Net Debit Cap in the 
future will be no fewer than ten days in 
advance of such decrease taking effect.
36 
DTC will also update Rule 9(B) to reflect 
that a transaction will not process if it 
causes a Participant in an Affiliated 
Family to exceed the Aggregate 
Affiliated Family Net Debit Cap, 
regardless of whether the Participant is 
the Instructor or Contra Party.
37 
As part of the Proposed Rule Change, 
DTC filed an Impact Study on the effects 
the Proposed Rule Change would have 
had on Participant’s liquidity needs 
conducted for the period June 2, 2024 
through January 31, 2025.
38 
Specifically, the Impact Study found 
that, out of 179 Participant families, 17 
would likely see a reduction of their 
need for SPPs after a Net Debit Cap 
increase. Specifically, an increase in the 
Net Debit Cap by $0.75 to $1 billion 
would lead to a reduction of $3.62 to 
$4.43 billion in daily SPP’s sent across 
the 17 families.
39 
Second, the Liquidity Fund 
component of the Participants Fund, set 
at $700 million, currently is funded 
solely by those Affiliated Families 
whose Net Debit Cap exceeds $2.15 
billion.
40 As the Proposed Rule Change 
would increase the Net Debit Cap for an 
individual Participant beyond $2.15 
billion, those Unaffiliated Participants 
whose Net Debit Cap exceeds $2.15 
billion will be included along with 
Affiliated Families with Net Debit Caps 
exceeding $2.15 billion in the allocation 
of the Liquidity Fund.
41 To reflect this 
change, the description of the Liquidity 
Fund within the Settlement Guide will 
be updated accordingly.
42 The Impact 
Study showed that with this Proposed 
Rule Change, two Unaffiliated 
Participants would become subject to 
the Liquidity Fund.
43 
The Settlement Guide would also be 
updated to reflect the new calculation to 
determine Liquidity Fund allocation 
between Affiliated Families and 
Independent Participants. Whereas 
within an Affiliated Family, each 
Participant of the Family pays a 
percentage portion of the allocated total 
owed by the Affiliated Family as a 
whole, an Individual Participant pays 
the entire allocated portion of the 
Liquidity Fund.
44 Additionally, several 
edits to the Liquidity Fund section are 
proposed to update and clarify the 
language for readability and 
simplicity.
45 
To simplify the description of the 
components of the Participants Fund, 
the Proposed Rule Change will revise 
the Amounts subsection to the 
Participants Fund and Preferred Stock 
Investment section of the Settlement 
Guide.
46 Currently, this section outlines 
four separate aspects of the Participants 
Fund: the Core Fund, the Base Fund, the 
Incremental Fund, and the Liquidity 
Fund. However, in practice, the Base 
Fund and Incremental Fund are the two 
components of the Core Fund.
47 To 
clarify this, the Proposed Rule Change 
will remove the Base Fund and 
Incremental Fund from the description 
of the separate component amounts 
which create the Participants Fund.
48 
Finally, the Proposed Rule Change 
would also add new definitions to the 
Settlement Guide and the Rules and 
update the description of the Collateral 
Monitor within the Settlement Guide. 
The Settlement Guide’s Important 
Terms section will be updated to 
include definitions for Affiliated Family 
and Unaffiliated Participant.
49 An 
Affiliated Family will mean ‘‘each 
Participant that controls or is controlled 
by another Participant and each 
Participant that is under the common 
control of any person.’’ Under this 
definition, ‘‘control’’ means the direct or 
indirect ownership of more than 50 
percent of the voting securities or voting 
interests of any person.
50 An 
Unaffiliated Participant will be defined 
to mean a Participant that is not 
included in an Affiliated Family.
51 The 
Settlement Guide will be edited further 
to refer to the Collateral Monitor as a 
‘‘calculation’’ rather than a ‘‘process.’’
52 
Finally, the term Aggregate Affiliated 
Family Net Debit will be added to Rule 
1 of the Rules and defined as, ‘‘the 
amount by which the algebraic sum of 
all money debits and charges to the 
Accounts of an Affiliated Family 
exceeds the sum of all money credits 
thereto.’’

IV. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
Section 19(b)(2)(C) of the Act
54 
directs the Commission to approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
such proposed rule change is consistent 
with the requirements of the Act and 
rules and regulations thereunder 
applicable to such organization. After 
careful review of the Proposed Rule 
Change, the Commission finds that the 
Proposed Rule Change is consistent 
with the requirements of the Act and the 
rules and regulations thereunder 
applicable to DTC. In particular, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act
55 and Rule 
17Ad–22(e)(7)(i) thereunder.56 
A. Consistency With Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act 
requires that the rules of a clearing 
agency, such as DTC, be designed to, 
among other things, promote the prompt

securities transactions and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a national system for the 
prompt and accurate clearance and

with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act for 
the reasons stated below. 
As noted in Section II above, the Net 
Debit Cap is a risk management tool 
utilized by DTC. By limiting the 
settlement net debit any Participant can 
incur at any point during the processing 
day to an amount below DTC’s liquidity 
resources, DTC uses the Net Debit Cap 
to protect the DTC settlement system in 
the event of a Participant default. This 
ensures that DTC maintains sufficient 
financial resources to complete 
settlement in the event of a failure to 
settle by the largest Participant or 
Affiliated Family of Participants. As 
noted in Section III above, DTC filed an 
Impact Study accompanying the 
Proposed Rule Change. The Commission 
has reviewed and analyzed the filing 
materials, including the Impact Study. 
An increase of the Net Debit Cap would 
not impact DTC’s ability to meet its 
liquidity obligations because, as 
discussed in Part III, the proposed Net 
Debit Cap increase would continue to be 
supported by sufficient DTC qualifying 
liquid resources, as the floating amount 
will always be lower than DTC’s total 
available liquidity.
58 Because the 
increase in Net Debit Cap should 
improve transaction processing while 
still ensuring that DTC has sufficient 
liquidity resources in the event of 
default, the Commission finds that the 
Proposed Rule Change should enhance 
DTC’s ability to provide prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions, consistent with 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. 
The Proposed Rule Change is 
consistent with removing impediments 
to and perfecting the mechanism of a 
national system for the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions. As described 
above, DTC employs Debit Caps as a risk 
management tool to regulate the total 
settlement obligation that any 
Participant or Affiliated Family may 
incur. As DTC does not process 
transactions that would result in a 
Participant exceeding its Net Debit Cap, 
such transactions remain pending until 
the Participant’s Net Debit Balance is 
sufficiently reduced to permit 
processing. By raising the Net Debit 
Cap, a greater number of transactions 
could be processed without requiring 
the Participant to first reduce its Net 
Debit Balance.
59 
The Commission has reviewed and 
analyzed the the Impact Study. The 
Impact Study demonstrates that an 
increase of the Net Debit Cap would 
elicit an immediate reduction in the 
number of SPPs required to complete 
transactions. A higher Net Debit Cap 
should reduce blockages from 
transactions pending due to a 
Participant reaching their Net Debit Cap 
and reduce the need to submit SPPs. 
Accordingly, the proposal is designed to 
remove impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a national system for the 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions, 
consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of 
the Act.
60 
B. Consistency With Rule 17Ad– 
22(e)(7)(i) 
Rule 17Ad–22(e)(7)(i) requires that, 
among other things, DTC establish, 
implement, maintain and enforce 
written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to, as applicable, 
effectively measure, monitor, and 
manage the liquidity risk that arises in 
or is borne by the covered clearing 
agency, including measuring, 
monitoring, and managing its settlement 
and funding flows on an ongoing and 
timely basis, and its use of intraday 
liquidity by maintaining sufficient 
liquid resources at the minimum in all 
relevant currencies to effect same-day, 
and, where appropriate, intraday and 
multiday settlement of payment 
obligations with a high degree of 
confidence under a wide range of 
foreseeable stress scenarios, that 
includes, but is not limited to, the 
default of the participant family that 
would generate the largest aggregate 
payment obligation for DTC in extreme 
but plausible market conditions.
61 
As discussed in Part II, the Net Debit 
Cap restricts a Participant’s net debit 
settlement obligation to an amount that 
can be satisfied with DTC’s liquidity 
resources at any point during its 
processing day. As outlined in Part III, 
the proposed increase in the Net Debit 
Cap would be capped by DTC’s 
available qualifying liquid resources 
when considering the Participants 
Fund, LOC, and Debt Issuance 
collectively, and it would not alter the 
current methods for monitoring 
settlement flows and net debit 
obligations. This should enable DTC to 
maintain sufficient liquid resources to 
meet its payment obligations under a 
wide range of foreseeable stress 
scenarios, including the default of the 
Individual Participant or Affiliated 
Family causing the largest aggregate 
payment obligation for DTC in extreme 
but plausible market conditions. 
For the reasons above, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with Rule 
17Ad–22(e)(7)(i) under the Act.
62 
V. Conclusion 
On the basis of the foregoing, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act, and in 
particular, with the requirements of 
Section 17A of the Act
63 and the rules 
and regulations promulgated 
thereunder. 
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
64 that 
proposed rule change SR–DTC–2025– 
019, be, and hereby is, APPROVED.
